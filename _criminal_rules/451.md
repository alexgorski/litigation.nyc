In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by the Local Criminal Rules, the

legal holidays are no longer excluded in computing periods of time. If the last day of the period is a
Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not
a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
