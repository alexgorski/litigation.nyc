(a) It is the duty of the lawyer or law firm, and of non-lawyer personnel employed by a
lawyer’s office or subject to a lawyer’s supervision, private investigators acting under the supervision
of a criminal defense lawyer, and government agents and police officers, not to release or authorize
the release of non-public information or opinion which a reasonable person would expect to be
disseminated by means of public communication, in connection with pending or imminent criminal
litigation with which they are associated, if there is a substantial likelihood that such dissemination
will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.

(b) With respect to a grand jury or other pending investigation of any criminal matter, a
lawyer participating in or associated with the investigation (including government lawyers and lawyers
for targets, subjects, and witnesses in the investigation) shall refrain from making any extrajudicial
statement which a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public
communication that goes beyond the public record or that is not necessary to inform the public that
the investigation is underway, to describe the general scope of the investigation, to obtain assistance
in the apprehension of a suspect, to warn the public of any dangers or otherwise to aid in the
investigation, if there is a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial
or otherwise prejudice the administration of justice.

(c) During a jury trial of any criminal matter, including the period of selection of the jury,
no lawyer or law firm associated with the prosecution or defense shall give or authorize any
extrajudicial statement or interview relating to the trial or the parties or issues in the trial which a
reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if there is a
substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with a fair trial; except that the lawyer or
the law firm may quote from or refer without comment to public records of the Court in the case.

(d) Statements concerning the following subject matters presumptively involve a substantial
likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due
administration of justice within the meaning of this rule:

  * (1) The prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments or other charges of
crime), or the character or reputation of the accused, except that the lawyer or law firm may
make a factual statement of the accused’s name, age, residence, occupation and family status;
and if the accused has not been apprehended, a lawyer associated with the prosecution may
release any information necessary to aid in the accused’s apprehension or to warn the public
of any dangers the accused may present;
  * (2) The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement given by
the accused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make any statement;
  * (3) The performance of any examinations or tests or the accused’s refusal or failure
to submit to an examination or test;
  * (4) The identity, testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses, except that the
lawyer or law firm may announce the identity of the victim if the announcement is not
otherwise prohibited by law;
  * (5) The possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a lesser offense;
  * (6) Information the lawyer or law firm knows is likely to be inadmissible at trial and
would if disclosed create a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an impartial trial; and
  * (7) Any opinion as to the accused’s guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case
or the evidence in the case.

(e) Statements concerning the following subject matters presumptively do not involve a
substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise
prejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of this rule:

  * (1) An announcement, at the time of arrest, of the fact and circumstances of arrest 
(including time and place of arrest, resistance, pursuit and use of weapons), the identity of the
investigating and arresting officer or agency and the length of investigation;
  * (2) An announcement, at the time of seizure, stating whether any items of physical
evidence were seized and, if so, a description of the items seized (but not including any
confession, admission or statement);
  * (3) The nature, substance or text of the charge, including a brief description of the
offense charged;
  * (4) Quoting or referring without comment to public records of the Court in the
case;
  * (5) An announcement of the scheduling or result of any stage in the judicial process,
or an announcement that a matter is no longer under investigation;
  * (6) A request for assistance in obtaining evidence; and
  * (7) An announcement, without further comment, that the accused denies the
charges, and a brief description of the nature of the defense.

(f) Nothing in this rule is intended to preclude the formulation or application of more
restrictive rules relating to the release of information about juvenile or other offenders, to preclude
the holding of hearings or the lawful issuance of reports by legislative, administrative or investigative
bodies, or to preclude any lawyer from replying to charges of misconduct that are publicly made
against said lawyer.

(g) All Court supporting personnel, including, among others, marshals, deputy marshals,
Court Clerks, bailiffs and Court reporters and employees or sub-contractors retained by the
Court-appointed official reporters, are prohibited from disclosing to any person, without
authorization by the Court, information relating to a pending grand jury proceeding or criminal case
that is not part of the public records of the Court. The divulgence by such Court supporting
personnel of information concerning grand jury proceedings, in camera arguments and hearings held 
in chambers or otherwise outside the presence of the public is also forbidden.

(h) The Court, on motion of either party or on its own motion, may issue a special order
governing such matters as extrajudicial statements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with the
rights of the accused to a fair trial by an impartial jury, the seating and conduct in the courtroom of
spectators and news media representatives, the management and sequestration of jurors and
witnesses and any other matters which the Court may deem appropriate for inclusion in such order.
In determining whether to impose such a special order, the Court shall consider whether such an
order will be necessary to ensure an impartial jury and must find that other, less extreme available
remedies, singly or collectively, are not feasible or would not effectively mitigate the pretrial publicity
and bring about a fair trial. Among the alternative remedies to be considered are: change of
venue, postponing the trial, a searching voir dire, emphatic jury instructions, and sequestration of
jurors.

(i) Any lawyer who violates the terms of this rule may be disciplined pursuant to Local Civil
Rule 1.5.
