---

An attorney who has appeared as attorney of record for a party may be relieved or displaced
only by order of the Court and may not withdraw from a case without leave of the Court granted by
order. Such an order may be granted only upon a showing by affidavit or otherwise of satisfactory
reasons for withdrawal or displacement and the posture of the case, including its position, if any, on
the calendar, and whether or not the attorney is asserting a retaining or charging lien. All
applications to withdraw must be served upon the client and (unless excused by the Court) upon all
other parties.
