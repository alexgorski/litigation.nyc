In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by the Local Civil Rules or the Local
Admiralty and Maritime Rules, the provisions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 6 shall apply unless otherwise stated.
In these Local Rules, as in the Federal Rules as amended effective December 1, 2009, Saturdays,
Sundays, and legal holidays are no longer excluded in computing periods of time. If the last day of
the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the
next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.
