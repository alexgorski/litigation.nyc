(a) Oath. Every person appointed pursuant to Rule 53 shall before entering upon his or
her duties take and subscribe an oath, which, except as otherwise prescribed by statute or rule, shall
be the same as the oath prescribed for Judges pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 453, with the addition of the
words “in conformance with the order of appointment” after the words “administer justice.” Such
an oath may be taken before any federal or state officer authorized by federal law to administer oaths,
and shall be filed in the office of the Clerk.

(b) May Sit Outside District. A person appointed pursuant to Rule 53 may sit within or
outside the district. When the person appointed is requested to sit outside the district for the 
convenience of a party and there is opposition by another party, he or she may make an order for the
holding of the hearing, or a part thereof, outside the district, upon such terms and conditions as shall
be just. Such order may be reviewed by the Court upon motion of any party, served within
twenty-one (21) days after service on all parties by the master of the order.
