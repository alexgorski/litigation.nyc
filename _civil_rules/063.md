Unless otherwise provided by the Court or by statute or rule (such as Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 52,
and 59), a notice of motion for reconsideration or reargument of a court order determining a motion
shall be served within fourteen (14) days after the entry of the Court's determination of the original
motion, or in the case of a court order resulting in a judgment, within fourteen (14) days after the
entry of the judgment. There shall be served with the notice of motion a memorandum setting
forth concisely the matters or controlling decisions which counsel believes the Court has
overlooked. The time periods for the service of answering and reply memoranda, if any, shall be governed by Local Civil Rule 6.1(a) or (b), as in the case of the original motion. No oral argument
shall be heard unless the Court directs that the matter shall be reargued orally. No affidavits shall
be filed by any party unless directed by the Court.
