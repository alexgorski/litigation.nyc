All counsel in civil cases shall seriously discuss the possibility of settlement a reasonable time
prior to trial. The Court may, in its discretion, assess the parties or counsel with the cost of one day's
attendance of the jurors if a case is settled after the jury has been summoned or during trial, the
amount to be paid to the Clerk of the Court. For purposes of this rule, a civil jury is considered
summoned for a trial as of Noon one day prior to the designated date of the trial.
