No motion under Rules 26 through 37 inclusive of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall
be heard unless counsel for the moving party has first requested an informal conference with the
Court by letter-motion for a pre-motion discovery conference (subject to the instructions regarding
ECF published on the Court's website and the Judge's Individual Practices) and such request has
either been denied or the discovery dispute has not been resolved as a consequence of such a
conference.
