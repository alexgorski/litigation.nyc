Unless otherwise provided by statute, applications for a writ of habeas corpus made by
persons under the judgment and sentence of a court of the State of New York shall be filed, heard
and determined in the District Court for the district within which they were convicted and sentenced;
provided, however, that if the convenience of the parties and witnesses requires a hearing in a
different district, such application may be transferred to any district which is found by the assigned
Judge to be more convenient. The Clerks of the Southern and Eastern District Courts are
authorized and directed to transfer such applications to the District herein designated for filing,
hearing and determination.
