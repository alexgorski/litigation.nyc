---

(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or directed by the Court, where a claim of privilege
is asserted in objecting to any means of discovery or disclosure, including but not limited to a
deposition, and an answer is not provided on the basis of such assertion,

  * (1) The person asserting the privilege shall identify the nature of the privilege
(including work product) which is being claimed and, if the privilege is governed by state law,
indicate the state's privilege rule being invoked; and
  * (2) The following information shall be provided in the objection, or (in the case of a
deposition) in response to questions by the questioner, unless divulgence of such information 
would cause disclosure of the allegedly privileged information:
    * (A) For documents: (i) the type of document, e.g., letter or memorandum;
(ii) the general subject matter of the document; (iii) the date of the document; and (iv)
the author of the document, the addressees of the document, and any other recipients, 
and, where not apparent, the relationship of the author, addressees, and recipients to
each other;
    * (B) For oral communications: (i) the name of the person making the
communication and the names of persons present while the communication was made
and, where not apparent, the relationship of the persons present to the person making
the communication; (ii) the date and place of communication; and (iii) the general
subject matter of the communication.

(b) Where a claim of privilege is asserted in response to discovery or disclosure other than a
deposition, and information is not provided on the basis of such assertion, the information set forth in
paragraph (a) above shall be furnished in writing at the time of the response to such discovery or
disclosure, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

(c) Efficient means of providing information regarding claims of privilege are encouraged,
and parties are encouraged to agree upon measures that further this end. For example, when
asserting privilege on the same basis with respect to multiple documents, it is presumptively proper to
provide the information required by this rule by group or category. A party receiving a privilege log
that groups documents or otherwise departs from a document-by-document or
communication-by-communication listing may not object solely on that basis, but may object if the
substantive information required by this rule has not been provided in a comprehensible form.
