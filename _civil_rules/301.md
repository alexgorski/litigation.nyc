When a deposition upon oral examination is to be taken at a place more than one hundred
(100) miles from the courthouse, any party may request the Court to issue an order providing that
prior to the examination, another party shall pay the expense (including a reasonable counsel fee) of
the attendance of one attorney for each other party at the place where the deposition is to be taken.
The amounts so paid, unless otherwise directed by the Court, may be taxed as a cost at the conclusion
of the action or proceeding.
