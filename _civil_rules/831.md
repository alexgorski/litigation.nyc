State requirement.
  * (2) The Court shall authorize payment to counsel for the infant or incompetent of a
reasonable attorney's fee and proper disbursements from the amount recovered in such an
action, whether realized by settlement, execution or otherwise and shall determine the said fee
and disbursements, after due inquiry as to all charges against the fund.
  * (3) The Court shall order the balance of the proceeds of the recovery or settlement to
be distributed as it deems may best protect the interest of the infant or incompetent.

(b) __Settlement of Wrongful Death Actions and Actions for Conscious Pain and Suffering of the Decedent.__

In an action for wrongful death or conscious pain and suffering of the decedent:

  * (1) Where required by statute or otherwise, the Court shall apportion the avails of the
action, and shall approve the terms of any settlement.
  * (2) The Court shall approve an attorney's fee only upon application in accordance
with the provisions of the New York State statutes and rules.
