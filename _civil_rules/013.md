(a) A member in good standing of the bar of the State of New York, or a member in good
standing of the bar of the United States District Court in Connecticut or Vermont and of the bar of
the State in which such district court is located, provided such district court by its rule extends a corresponding privilege to members of the bar of this Court, may be admitted to practice in this
Court on compliance with the following provisions:

In the first instance, each applicant for admission is required to file an application for
admission in electronic form on the Court's Web site. This one application will be utilized both to
admit and then to provide the applicant to the bar of this Court with a password and login for use
on the Court's Electronic Case Filing (ECF) system. The applicant shall adhere to all applicable
rules of admission.

The applicant shall (a) complete the application on-line, (b) submit the application
electronically, (c) print and sign a copy of the application, and (d) file the printed application and fee
with the Clerk, together with a certificate(s) of good standing and a supporting affidavit(s).

After submitting the application in electronic form, each applicant for admission shall file
with the Clerk, at least ten (10) days prior to hearing (unless, for good cause shown, the Judge shall
shorten the time), the signed paper copy of the verified written petition for admission stating: (1)
applicant's residence and office address; (2) the time when, and courts where, admitted; (3)
applicant's legal training and experience; (4) whether applicant has ever been held in contempt of
court, and, if so, the nature of the contempt and the final disposition thereof; (5) whether applicant
has ever been censured, suspended, disbarred or denied admission or readmission by any court, and,
if so, the facts and circumstances connected therewith; (6) that applicant has read and is familiar 
with (a) the provisions of the Judicial Code (Title 28, U.S.C.) which pertain to the jurisdiction of, and
practice in, the United States District Courts; (b) the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (c) the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (d) the Federal Rules of Evidence; (e) the Local Rules of the
United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York; and (f) the New
York State Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted from time to time by the Appellate Divisions
of the State of New York; and (7) that applicant will faithfully adhere to all rules applicable to
applicant's conduct in connection with any activities in this Court.

The petition shall be accompanied by a certificate of the clerk of the court for each of the
states in which the applicant is a member of the bar, which has been issued within thirty (30) days of
filing and states that the applicant is a member in good standing of the bar of that state court. The
petition shall also be accompanied by an affidavit of an attorney of this Court who has known the
applicant for at least one year, stating when the affiant was admitted to practice in this Court, how
long and under what circumstances the attorney has known the applicant, and what the attorney
knows of the applicant's character and experience at the bar. Such petition shall be placed at the
head of the calendar and, on the call thereof, the attorney whose affidavit accompanied the petition
shall personally move the admission of the applicant. If the petition is granted, the applicant shall
take the oath of office and sign the roll of attorneys.

A member of the bar of the state of New York, Connecticut, or Vermont who has been
admitted to the bar of this Court pursuant to this subsection and who thereafter voluntarily resigns
from membership in the bar of the state pursuant to which he was admitted to the bar of this Court,
and who does not within 30 days of that voluntary resignation file an affidavit with the Clerk of this
Court indicating that such person remains eligible to be admitted to the bar of this Court pursuant
to other provisions of this subsection (such as because he is still a member of the bar of another
eligible state and, where applicable, a corresponding district court), shall be deemed to have
voluntarily resigned from the bar of this Court as of the same date the member resigned from the 
bar of the underlying state, provided that such resignation shall not be deemed to deprive this Court
of jurisdiction to impose discipline on this person, pursuant to Rule 1.5 infra, for conduct preceding
the date of such resignation.

(b) A member in good standing of the bar of either the Southern or Eastern District of
New York may be admitted to the bar of the other district without formal application (1) upon filing
in that district a certificate of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the district in which
the applicant is a member of the bar, which has been issued within thirty (30) days of filing and
states that the applicant is a member in good standing of the bar of that Court and (2) upon taking
the oath of office, signing the roll of attorneys of that district, and paying the fee required in that
district.

(c) A member in good standing of the bar of any state or of any United States District
Court may be permitted to argue or try a particular case in whole or in part as counsel or advocate,
upon motion (which may be made by the applicant) and upon filing with the Clerk of the District
Court a certificate of the court for each of the states in which the applicant is a member of the bar,
which has been issued within thirty (30) days of filing and states that the applicant is a member in
good standing of the bar of that state court, and upon paying the required fee. Attorneys appearing
for the Department of Justice may appear before the Court without requesting pro hac vice
admission. Attorneys appearing for other federal agencies must move for pro hac vice admission but
the fee requirement is waived and the certificate(s) of good standing may have been issued within
one year of filing. Only an attorney who has been so admitted or who is a member of the bar of this
Court may enter appearances for parties, sign stipulations or receive payments upon judgments,
decrees or orders.

(d) If an attorney who is a member of the bar of this Court, or who has been authorized to
appear in a case in this Court, changes his or her residence or office address, the attorney shall
immediately notify the Clerk of the Court, in addition to serving and filing a notice of change of
address in each pending case in which the attorney has appeared.
