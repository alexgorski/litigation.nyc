---

(a) Good-Faith Effort to Resolve. Prior to seeking judicial resolution of a discovery or
non-dispositive pretrial dispute, the attorneys for the affected parties or non-party witness shall
attempt to confer in good faith in person or by telephone in an effort to resolve the dispute, in
conformity with Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1).

(b) Disputes Arising During Depositions. Where the attorneys for the affected parties
or a non-party witness cannot agree on a resolution of a discovery dispute that arises during a
deposition, they shall, to the extent practicable, notify the Court by telephone and seek a ruling while
the deposition is in progress. If a prompt ruling cannot be obtained, and the dispute involves an 
instruction to the witness not to answer a question, the instruction not to answer may stand and the
deposition shall continue until a ruling is obtained pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph
(c) below.

(c) Other Discovery and Non-Dispositive Pretrial Disputes. Where the attorneys for
the affected parties or non-party witness cannot agree on a resolution of any other discovery dispute
or non-dispositive pretrial dispute, or if they are unable to obtain a telephonic ruling on a discovery
dispute that arises during a deposition as provided in paragraph (b) above, they shall notify the Court
by letter not exceeding three pages in length outlining the nature of the dispute and attaching relevant
materials. Within four days of receiving such a letter, any opposing affected party or non-party 
witness may submit a responsive letter not exceeding three pages attaching relevant materials.
Except for the letters and attachments authorized herein, or where a ruling which was made
exclusively as a result of a telephone conference is the subject of de novo review pursuant to paragraph
(d) hereof, papers shall not be submitted with respect to a dispute governed by this rule unless the
Court has so directed.

(d) Motion for Reconsideration. A ruling made exclusively as a result of a telephone
conference may be the subject of de novo reconsideration by a letter not exceeding five pages in length 
attaching relevant materials submitted by any affected party or non-party witness. Within four days
of receiving such a letter, any other affected party or non-party witness may submit a responsive
letter not exceeding five pages in length attaching relevant materials.

(e) Decision of the Court. The Court shall record or arrange for the recording of the
Court's decision in writing. Such written order may take the form of an oral order read into the
record of a deposition or other proceeding, a handwritten memorandum, a handwritten marginal
notation on a letter or other document, or any other form the Court deems appropriate. 

###Local Civil Rule 39.1. Custody of Trial and Hearing Exhibits
(a) Unless the Court orders otherwise, trial and hearing exhibits shall not be filed with the
Clerk, but shall be retained in the custody of the respective attorneys who produced them in court.

(b) Trial and hearing exhibits which have been filed with the Clerk shall be removed by the
party responsible for them (1) if no appeal is taken, within ninety (90) days after a final decision is
rendered, or (2) if an appeal has been taken, within thirty (30) days after the final disposition of the
appeal. Parties failing to comply with this rule shall be notified by the Clerk to remove their exhibits
and upon their failure to do so within thirty (30) days, the Clerk may dispose of them as the Clerk
may see fit.
