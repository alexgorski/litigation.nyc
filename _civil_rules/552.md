(a) __By the Clerk.__ Upon issuance of a Clerk's certificate of default, if the claim to which no
response has been made only sought payment of a sum certain, and does not include a request for
attorney's fees or other substantive relief, and if a default judgment is sought against all remaining
parties to the action, the moving party shall submit an affidavit showing the principal amount due
and owing, not exceeding the amount sought in the claim to which no response has been made, plus
interest, if any, computed by the party, with credit for all payments received to date clearly set forth,
and costs, if any, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1920.

(b) __By the Court.__ In all other cases the party seeking a judgment by default shall apply to
the Court as described in Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2), and shall append to the application (1) the Clerk's
certificate of default, (2) a copy of the claim to which no response has been made, and (3) a proposed
form of default judgment.

(c) __Mailing of Papers.__ Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, all papers submitted to
the Court pursuant to Local Civil Rule 55.2(a) or (b) above shall simultaneously be mailed to the
party against whom a default judgment is sought at the last known residence of such party (if an
individual) or the last known business address of such party (if a person other than an individual).
Proof of such mailing shall be filed with the Court. If the mailing is returned, a supplemental
affidavit shall be filed with the Court setting forth that fact, together with the reason provided for
return, if any.
