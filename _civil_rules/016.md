(a) It shall be the continuing duty of each attorney appearing in any civil or criminal case to
bring promptly to the attention of the Court all facts which said attorney believes are relevant to a
determination that said case and one or more pending civil or criminal cases should be heard by the
same Judge, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of judicial effort. As soon as the attorney
becomes aware of such relationship, said attorney shall notify the Judges to whom the cases have
been assigned.

(b) If counsel fails to comply with Local Civil Rule 1.6(a), the Court may assess reasonable
costs directly against counsel whose action has obstructed the effective administration of the Court's
business.
