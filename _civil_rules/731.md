(a) When a civil action is filed with the Clerk, the Clerk shall give the filing party notice of the
Magistrate Judge's consent jurisdiction in a form approved by the Court, with sufficient copies to be
served with the complaint on adversary parties. A copy of such notice shall be attached to any
third-party complaint served by a defendant.

(b) When a completed consent form has been filed, the Clerk shall forward the form for
final approval to the District Judge to whom the case was originally assigned. Once the District
Judge has approved the transfer and returned the consent form to the Clerk for filing, the clerk shall
reassign the case for all purposes to the Magistrate Judge previously designated to receive any
referrals or to whom the case has previously been referred for any purpose, except that, in the
Eastern District of New York, upon application of the parties, the Clerk shall select a new Magistrate
Judge at random. If no designation or referral has been made, the Clerk shall select a new
Magistrate Judge at random.
