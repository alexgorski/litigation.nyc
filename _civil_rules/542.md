The Court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order any party to file an original bond for
costs or additional security for costs in such an amount and so conditioned as it may designate. For
failure to comply with the order the Court may make such orders in regard to noncompliance as are
just, and among others the following: an order striking out pleadings or staying further proceedings
until the bond is filed or dismissing the action or rendering a judgment by default against the
non-complying party.
