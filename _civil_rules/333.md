(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery,
interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information
relevant to the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and
the existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.

(b) During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described in
paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method of obtaining the
information sought than a request for production or a deposition, or (2) if ordered by the Court.

(c) At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery cut-off
date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing party may be served unless
the Court has ordered otherwise.
