In all cases in which a party files a pleading seeking a declaratory judgment that a patent is not
infringed, is invalid, or is unenforceable, Local Patent Rule 6 shall not apply with respect to such
patent unless and until a claim for patent infringement of such patent is made by a party. If a party
does not assert a claim for patent infringement in its answer to the declaratory judgment pleading,
unless otherwise specified in the Courtâ€™s Scheduling Order, the party seeking a declaratory judgment
must serve upon all parties its Invalidity Contentions with respect to such patent that conform to
Local Patent Rule 7 not later than forty-five (45) days after the Initial Scheduling Conference.
