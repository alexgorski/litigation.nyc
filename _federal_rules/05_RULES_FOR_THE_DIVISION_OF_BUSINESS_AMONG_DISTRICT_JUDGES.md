###SOUTHERN DISTRICT
These rules are adopted for the internal management of the case load of the court and shall
not be deemed to vest any rights in litigants or their attorneys and shall be subject to such
amendments from time to time as shall be approved by the court.

###Rule 1. Individual Assignment System
This court shall operate under an individual assignment system to assure continuous and
close judicial supervision of every case. Each civil and criminal action and proceeding, except as
otherwise provided, shall be assigned by lot to one judge for all purposes. The system shall be
administered by an assignment committee in such a manner that all active judges, except the chief
judge, shall be assigned substantially an equal share of the categories of cases of the court over a
period of time. There shall be assigned or transferred to the chief judge such matters as the chief
judge is willing and able to undertake, consistent with the chief judge's administrative duties.

###Rule 2. Assignment Committee
An assignment committee is established for the administration of the assignment system.
The committee shall consist of the chief judge and two other active judges selected by the chief
judge, each to serve for one year. The chief judge shall also select two other active judges, each to
serve for a period of one year, as alternate members of the committee.

The assignment committee shall supervise and rule upon all issues relating to assignments
under this system, in accordance with these rules, as amended from time to time by the board of
judges.

###Rule 3. Part I
(a) Establishment of Part I
Part I is established for hearing and determining certain emergency and miscellaneous matters
in civil and criminal cases. Judges shall choose assignment to Part I from an appropriate schedule,
in order of their seniority, for periods not to exceed three weeks in each year. The judge(s) assigned
full-time to White Plains do not sit in Part I in Manhattan. The assignment committee may, on
consent of the judges affected, change such assignments, if necessary, to meet the needs of the court.

Part I shall be open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday except on holidays.
The judge presiding in Part I may fix such other times for any proceeding as necessary.

(b) Civil Proceedings in Part I
Civil matters other than emergencies shall be heard on Tuesdays at 10:00 a.m. Admissions
to the bar shall be heard on Tuesdays at 11:00 a.m. Naturalization proceedings shall be conducted
on Fridays at 11:00 a.m. The court does not hold naturalization proceedings in White Plains.

  * (i) Miscellaneous Civil Matters.
The judge presiding in Part I shall hear and determine all miscellaneous proceedings
in civil matters, such as applications for relief relating to orders and subpoenas of
administrative agencies and for subpoenas issued in this district for cases outside the district.
  * (ii) Civil Emergency Matters.
The Part I judge shall hear and determine all emergency matters in civil cases which
have been assigned to a judge when the assigned judge is absent or has expressly referred the
matter to Part I only when that judge is unavailable due to extraordinary circumstances. In
the absence of a judge at the White Plains Courthouse, emergency matters are heard in Part I
at the Manhattan Courthouse. Depending on the procedures the Part I judge deems the
more efficient, the Part I judge may either dispose of an emergency matter only to the extent 
necessary to meet the emergency, or, on consent of the assigned judge and notice to the clerk,
transfer the action to himself or herself for all further proceedings.
  * (iii) Subsequent Emergency Proceedings.
If a civil emergency matter is brought before the Part 1 judge and the judge concludes
that for lack of emergency or otherwise the proceeding should not be determined in Part I,
the party who brought the proceeding shall not present the same matter again to any other
Part I judge unless relevant circumstances have changed in the interim in which case the party
shall advise the judge of the prior proceedings and changed circumstances.
  * (iv) Modifications
When a modification or further action on a Part I determination is sought, it shall be referred
in the first instance to the judge who made the original determination even though that judge
is no longer sitting in Part I.

(c) Criminal Proceedings in Part I
The judge presiding in Part I shall:

  * (i) Hear and determine all emergency matters in criminal cases which have been
assigned to a judge when the assigned judge is absent or has expressly referred the matter to
Part I only when that judge is unavailable due to extraordinary circumstances. In the
absence of a judge at the White Plains Courthouse, emergency matters are heard in Part I at
the Manhattan Courthouse.
  * (ii) Hear and determine appeals from orders of a magistrate judge in cases
that have not yet been assigned to a district judge.

Rule 4. Civil Actions or Proceedings (Filing and Assignment)
(a) Filing with the Clerk.
All civil actions and proceedings shall be numbered consecutively by year upon the filing of
the first document in the case.
When a complaint or the first document is filed in a civil action or proceeding, counsel shall
accurately complete and file form JS44C-SDNY: Civil Court Cover Sheet, in triplicate, consistent
with Rule 18 below.
(b) Assignment by the Clerk by Lot.
 Each civil action and proceeding, except applications for leave to proceed in forma pauperis,
upon being filed and each appeal from the bankruptcy court upon being docketed in this court shall
be assigned by lot within each designated category to a district judge for all purposes.
An action, case or proceeding may not be dismissed and thereafter refiled for the purpose of
obtaining a different judge. If an action, case or proceeding, or one essentially the same, is
dismissed and refiled, it shall be assigned to the same judge. It is the duty of every attorney
appearing to bring the facts of the refiling to the attention of the clerk.

Rule 5. Criminal Actions or Proceedings (Filing and Assignment)
(a) Filing With the Clerk.
Criminal actions shall be numbered consecutively by year upon the filing of the indictment
or information. The number of a superseding indictment or information shall be preceded by the
letter "S".
When an indictment or information is filed, the United States Attorney shall simultaneously
file the original and two copies of the indictment or information. The United States Attorney shall
also supply form AO257: Defendant Information Relative to a Criminal Action and the Designation
Form issued by the United States Attorney, in triplicate.

Rule 6. Criminal Proceedings
(a) Indictments designated for Manhattan may be returned by the grand jury in open court to
the magistrate judge presiding in the criminal part. Indictments designated for White Plains may be
returned by the grand jury to the magistrate judge presiding in the White Plains Courthouse.
(b) Assignments.
In a criminal case, after an indictment has been returned by the Grand Jury or a notice has
been filed by the United States Attorney's Office of an intention to file an information upon the
defendant's waiver of indictment, the magistrate judge on duty will randomly draw from the criminal
wheel, in open court, the name of a judge to whom the case should be assigned for all purposes.
The notice to file an information upon the defendant's waiver of indictment shall be signed by the
Unites States Attorney's Office and by the defendant's attorney. Waiver of indictment cases will not
be assigned a criminal docket number until the waiver has been accepted by the assigned judge.
Sealed indictments will be assigned a criminal docket number upon filing, but a judge will not be
selected until such time that the indictment is unsealed.
(c) Arraignments.
The United States Attorney's Office will promptly contact the judge to whom the case is
assigned and request the scheduling of a pretrial conference at which the defendant will be arraigned.
(d) Waiver of Indictments.
When any person offers to waive indictment, the judge to whom the case has been assigned
will conduct such proceedings as may be required by law to establish that the waiver is both knowing
and voluntary before an information is filed. The judge shall then arraign the defendant. If the
defendant fails to waive indictment and is subsequently indicted on the same or similar charges, the
case shall be assigned by the clerk to the same judge to whom the original information was assigned.
(e) Assignment of Superseding Indictments and Informations.
A superseding indictment or information will be assigned to the same judge to whom the 
original indictment or information was assigned.
(f) This rule applies to Manhattan. The judges in the White Plains Courthouse will
continue to follow such procedures as they find convenient.

Rule 7. Cases Certified for Prompt Trial or Disposition
When the assignment committee certifies that a case requires extraordinary priority or a
prompt trial or other disposition, it shall so advise the judge to whom the case has been assigned.
The judge so assigned shall advise the assignment committee whether that judge can accord the case
the required priority. In the event the judge so assigned advises the assignment committee that he
or she cannot accord the required priority, the case shall immediately be assigned to another judge by
lot and the same procedure followed until the case is assigned to a judge able to accord it the required
priority. The name of the judge to be so assigned shall be drawn by lot in the same manner as other
civil and criminal actions are initially assigned.

Rule 8. Criminal Motions
Motions in criminal actions shall be made returnable before the assigned judge at such time as
that judge directs. Criminal motions must be made within the time required by the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure and the Criminal Rules of this court.

Rule 9. Petitions for Collateral Relief from Convictions
(a) Federal Convictions.
When a motion for collateral relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 or an audita querellas is filed, it
shall be assigned for all further proceedings to the judge to whom the underlying case was assigned.
That judge may either act on the motion without responsive papers or advise the United States
attorney of the date(s) when responsive papers are due.
When a motion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) for the return of property seized in a criminal
case is filed, it shall be assigned for all further proceedings to the judge to whom the underlying case
was assigned. The judge may either act on the motion without responsive papers or advise the 
United States attorney of the date(s) when responsive papers are due. Rule 41(g) motions that are
filed after the related criminal case is closed, shall be opened as a new civil action, and all filings shall
be docketed therein.
If the judge to whom the underlying case was assigned is unable to entertain the motion, the
motion shall be assigned by lot, or to the Chief Judge where appropriate.
(b) State Convictions
When a pro se petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 for collateral relief from a state conviction is
filed, the Pro Se Office shall first ascertain whether the petition is properly filed and, if not, the Office
shall take proper steps to have it corrected. The Pro Se Office shall ascertain if the petition is related
to any prior application and, if so, send a memorandum to that judge pursuant to Rule 13 of these
Rules for a determination on relatedness. If there was a related case but the judge to whom that
case was assigned is unable or declines to entertain the petition, or if the petition is unrelated to any
prior application, the petition shall be assigned pursuant to Rule 21 of these Rules, or to the Chief
Judge where appropriate. 

Rule 10. Assignments to New Judges
When a new judge is inducted, the assignment committee shall transfer to the new judge an
equal share of all cases then pending (including cases on the suspense docket).
The cases shall be taken equally, by lot, from the dockets of each of the judges' most recent
chronological list of cases which have been designated by the transferor as eligible for transfer, except
if the Assignment Committee determines that the interests of court administration requires an
alternative method of reassignment. No case shall be transferred without the consent of the
transferor judge. The assignment committee shall also direct the clerk to add the name of the new
judge to the random selection system for assigning new cases to active judges.

Rule 11. Assignments to Senior Judges
If a senior judge is willing and able to undertake assignment of new cases for all purposes,
that judge shall advise the assignment committee of the number and categories of new cases which
that judge is willing and able to undertake. New cases in the requested number in each category
shall then be assigned to that judge in the same manner as new cases are assigned to active judges.
If a senior judge is willing and able to undertake assignment of pending cases from other
judges, that judge may (1) accept assignment of all or any part of any case from any judge on mutual
consent, or (2) advise the assignment committee of the number, status and categories of pending
cases which that judge is willing to undertake. Such cases will be drawn by lot from current lists
provided to the assignment committee by the judges wishing to transfer cases under this rule. If a
senior judge does not terminate any action so transferred, it shall be reassigned to the transferor
judge.

Rule 12. Assignments to Visiting Judges
When a visiting judge is assigned to this district, that judge shall advise the assignment
committee of the number and categories of pending cases which that judge is required or willing to
accept. The assignment committee shall then transfer to that judge the required number of cases in
each category with the consent of the transferor judge. If the visiting judge does not terminate the
action, it shall be reassigned to the transferor judge.

Rule 13. Related Cases
(a) Determination of Relatedness
(1) General Rule. Subject to the limitations set forth below, a civil case,
bankruptcy appeal, or motion to withdraw the bankruptcy reference will be deemed related to one or
more civil cases, appeals or motions when the interests of justice and efficiency will be served. In
determining relatedness, a judge will consider whether (A) the actions concern the same or
substantially similar parties, property, transactions or events; (B) there is substantial factual overlap; 
(C) the parties could be subjected to conflicting orders; and (D) whether absent a determination of
relatedness there would be a substantial duplication of effort and expense, delay, or undue burden on
the Court, parties or witnesses. Bankruptcy appeals are deemed related if they arise from the same
order or judgment of the bankruptcy court. Motions to withdraw the bankruptcy reference are
deemed related if they seek withdrawal with respect to all or part(s) of the same adversary proceeding.
Nothing in this Rule is intended to preclude parties from moving for consolidated proceedings under
Fed. R. Civ. P. 42.
 (2) Limitations on General Rule. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1):
 (A) Civil cases shall not be deemed related merely because they involve
common legal issues or the same parties.
 (B) Other than cases subject to Rule 4(b) and actions seeking the
enforcement of a judgment or settlement in or of an earlier case, civil cases presumptively shall not
be deemed related unless both cases are pending before the Court (or the earlier case is on appeal).
 (C) Criminal cases are not treated as related to civil cases. Criminal cases are
not treated as related to each other unless a motion is granted for a joint trial.
 (D) Bankruptcy appeals and motions to withdraw the reference are not treated
as related merely because they arise from the same bankruptcy proceeding.
(b) Procedure in Regard to Cases Said to be Related
(1) Disclosure of contention of relatedness. When a civil case is filed or
removed or a bankruptcy appeal or motion to withdraw the reference of an adversary proceeding
from the bankruptcy court is filed, the person filing or removing shall disclose on form JSC44C any
contention of relatedness and shall file a Related Case Statement stating clearly and succinctly the
basis for the contention. A copy of the civil cover sheet and Related Case Statement shall be served
with the complaint, notice of removal, notice of appeal, or motion. Any party may contest a claim
of relatedness by any other in writing addressed to the judge having the case with the lowest docket 
number of all cases claimed to be related. However, the foregoing shall not delay the assignment
process or the operation of this Rule.
(2) Assignment of cases that are designated as related. A case, bankruptcy appeal,
or motion to withdraw the bankruptcy reference that is designated as related shall be forwarded to
the judge before whom the allegedly related case, appeal or motion having the lowest docket number
is or was pending, who shall decide whether to accept or reject the case. The decision of the judge
with the lowest docket number shall control unless the Assignment Committee determines otherwise,
applying the standards of relatedness set forth in this Rule. The judge with the lowest docket
number shall notify the Assignment Committee of his or her decision to accept or reject the case,
appeal or motion and provide the Committee with the Related Case Statement and any submission in
opposition to the contention that the cases are related. If the Assignment Committee does not
concur with the judge’s decision to accept the allegedly related case, appeal or motion, the matter
shall be assigned by the Clerk by random selection.
(3) Claims of relatedness by other parties. A party other than the one filing a
case, bankruptcy appeal or motion to withdraw the reference that contends its case is related to
another may so advise in writing the judge assigned in its case and request a transfer of its case to the
judge that the party contends has the related case with the lowest docket number. If the assigned
judge believes the case is related under paragraph (a), he or she shall refer the question to the judge
having the case with the lowest docket number. In the event the latter judge agrees, the case shall
be transferred to that judge unless the Assignment Committee disagrees. 
(c) Other Matters
(1) Motions in civil and criminal cases to consolidate, or for a joint trial, are
regulated by the Federal Rules. A defendant in a criminal case may move on notice to have all of his
or her sentences in this district imposed by a single judge. All such motions shall be noticed for
hearing before the judge having the lowest docket number, with courtesy copies to be provided to the judge or judges having the cases with the higher docket numbers.

Rule 14. Transfer of Cases by Consent
Any judge, upon written advice to the assignment committee, may transfer directly any case
or any part of any case on that judge's docket to any consenting judge except where Rule 16 applies.

Rule 15. Transfers from Senior Judges
A senior judge may keep as much of his or her existing docket as that judge desires and
furnish the assignment committee with a list of all cases which the judge desires to have transferred.
The assignment committee will distribute the cases equally by lot to each active judge.

Rule 16. Transfer Because of Disqualification, etc.
If a judge is disqualified or if a judge has presided at a mistrial or former trial of the case, and
requests reassignment, the assignment committee shall transfer the case by lot.

Rule 17. Transfer of Cases Because of a Judge’s Death, Resignation, Prolonged Illness,
Disability, Unavoidable Absence, or Excessive Backlog
The assignment committee shall, in the case of death or resignation, and may, in the event of
a judge’s prolonged illness, disability, unavoidable absence, or the build up of an excessive backlog,
transfer any case or cases pending on the docket of that judge by distributing them to any judge or
visiting judge willing to accept such case and thereafter, distributing them as equally as is feasible by
lot, to all remaining active judges and to such senior judges who are willing and able to undertake them.

Rule 18. Designation of White Plains Cases
(a) Civil.
At the time of filing, the plaintiff’s attorney shall designate on the civil cover sheet whether
the case should be assigned to White Plains or Manhattan in accordance with these rules.
A civil case shall be designated for assignment to White Plains if:
(i) The claim arose in whole or in major part in the Counties of Dutchess, Orange,
Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Westchester (the "Northern Counties") and at least one of
the parties resides in the Northern Counties; or
(ii) The claim arose in whole or in major part in the Northern Counties and none of
the parties resides in this District.
A civil case may also be designated for assignment to White Plains if:
(iii) The claim arose outside this district and at least some of the parties reside in the
Northern Counties; or
(iv) At least half of the parties reside in the Northern Counties.
All civil cases other than those specified in the foregoing paragraphs (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)
and social security and habeas corpus petitions brought under 28 U.S.C. §2241 which are assigned on
a district-wide basis shall be designated for assignment to Manhattan.
(b) Criminal.
The U.S. attorney designates on the criminal cover sheet that the case is to be assigned to
White Plains if the crime was allegedly committed in whole or predominant part in the Northern
Counties.
Defendants in any criminal case designated for White Plains may be arraigned at the White
Plains Courthouse before a magistrate judge or a district judge.
Bail applications in any case designated for White Plains may be heard before a magistrate 
judge at White Plains, or, if unavailable, before a judge in White Plains, or a magistrate judge in
Manhattan.

Rule 19. Reassignment of Cases to/from White Plains
If the Judge to whom the case is assigned determines that it should be assigned to the other
courthouse under these rules, it is sent to the Clerk for reassignment to a judge in the other
courthouse. If upon reassignment there is a dispute as to the proper place of holding court, it will
be referred to the Assignment Committee for final determination. If the case is reassigned, it will be
reassigned as if it were a new filing, but will retain its original case number.
Rule 20. Removed Actions and Bankruptcy Matters
Actions removed from a state court in New York County or Bronx County will be assigned
to Manhattan. Actions removed from a state court in any of the other counties within the district
will be assigned to White Plains. In either case, the attorney for the defendant may move for
reassignment as provided in the section entitled Reassignment of Cases.
Bankruptcy appeals from the White Plains and Poughkeepsie bankruptcy courts are also
assigned to White Plains.
Rule 21. Social Security Actions and Habeas Corpus Petitions
Social security cases and petitions for habeas corpus relief
under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 shall be assigned proportionately to all judges of the Court, whether
sitting in White Plains or Manhattan.
Habeas corpus petitions brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 shall be assigned as follows:
where the habeas corpus petitions arise out of state convictions obtained in the counties of
Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan, the cases shall be assigned to
district judges assigned to White Plains; where the habeas corpus petitions arise out of state
convictions obtained in the counties of Bronx and New York, the cases shall be assigned to
district judges assigned to Manhattan.

Rule 22. Filing at Either Courthouse
Complaints and all subsequent papers are accepted at either courthouse, regardless of the
place for which the case is designated.




EASTERN DISTRICT
ADOPTED PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 137
These rules are adopted for the internal management of the case load of the court and shall
not be deemed to vest any rights in litigants or their attorneys and shall be subject to such
amendments from time to time as shall be approved by the court.

50.1 Categories and Classification of Cases; Information on Cases and Parties
(a) Categories of Cases.
Cases shall be divided into the following main categories:
(1) Civil.
(A) Regular.
(B) Multidistrict litigation.
(C) Patent.
(2) Criminal.
(3) Miscellaneous.
(b) Information Sheet.
 The party filing the initial paper in a civil or criminal case shall complete and attach an
information sheet. The information sheet shall be placed in the case file.
Where it appears to the Court that the filing party's reasons for joinder of parties are not
apparent from the face of the complaint, the Clerk of Court is authorized to request a written
explanation consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 and any other appropriate Federal
Rule. The response of the filing party will be docketed and a copy forwarded to the assigned 
udicial officer.
 (c) Disclosure of Interested Parties.
To enable judges and magistrates to evaluate possible disqualification or recusal, counsel for a
private (nongovernmental) party shall submit at the time of initial pleading a certificate identifying
any corporate parent, subsidiaries, or affiliates of that party.
(d) Long Island Cases.
(1) A criminal case shall be designated a “Long Island case” if the crime was
allegedly committed wholly or in substantial part in Nassau or Suffolk County.
2) A civil case shall be designated a Long Island case if:
a) the case has been removed to this Court from a New York State court
located in Nassau or Suffolk County, or
b) in any other case,
i) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the
claim or claims occurred in Nassau or Suffolk County, or
ii) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the
claim or claims did not occur in the Eastern District of New York and
the defendant (or a majority of the defendants if there is more than
one) resides in Nassau or Suffolk County or, in an interpleader action,
the claimant (or a majority of the claimants if there is more than one)
resides in Nassau or Suffolk County.
For purposes of this rule, a corporation shall be considered a resident of the
county in which it has the most significant contacts.
(3) As provided in 50.2(f) a party may move to designate a case as a Long Island
case or to cancel such designation on the grounds that such action will serve the convenience of the
parties and witnesses or is otherwise in the interests of justice.
(e) Miscellaneous Cases.
All matters that do not receive a civil or criminal docket number shall be given a miscellaneous docket
number and assigned as provided in 50.5 of these rules.
[Amended: September 9th, 2014]

50.2 Assignment of Cases
(a) Time of Assignment.
The clerk shall assign a civil case upon the filing of the initial pleading. In a criminal case
after an indictment is returned or after an information (including a juvenile information under
18 U.S.C. § 5032) or a motion to transfer under 18 U.S.C. § 5032 has been filed, the United States
Attorney shall refer the case to the clerk who shall then assign the case. The United States attorney
shall arrange with the judge to whom the case is assigned, or if that judge is absent or unavailable as
provided in 50.5, with the miscellaneous judge, to have the defendant arraigned and a plea entered as
promptly as practicable.
(b) Random Selection Procedure.
All cases shall be randomly assigned by the clerk or his designee in public view in one of the
clerk's offices in such a manner that each active judge shall receive as nearly as possible the same
number of cases, except as provided in paragraph (h) Where a party or his counsel requests prior to
selection that he or she be present at the selection, the clerk shall make reasonable efforts to comply
with the request. In Brooklyn civil cases a magistrate judge shall be drawn at the same time and in
the same manner as a judge. All Long Island civil cases shall be assigned to the Long Island
magistrate judge. The parties to any Long Island case assigned to a Brooklyn judge may stipulate
that the case be assigned to the Long Island magistrate judge, for pretrial purposes.
(c) Assignment of Civil Cases.
(1) There shall be separate Brooklyn and Long Island civil assignment wheels.
At least quarterly the Chief Judge shall fix the proportion of cases to be assigned to the Long Island
courthouses so as to distribute the civil cases relatively equally among all the active judges.
(2) There shall be separate patent assignment wheels for district judges and
magistrate judges. A district judge or magistrate judge not in the patent assignment wheel who
received a new patent case by random selection from the civil assignment wheel may elect, within
thirty (30) days of assignment for district judges and seven (7) days of assignment for magistrate
judges, to direct reassignment of the case. A new district or magistrate judge, or both, will then be
assigned by random selection from the appropriate patent assignment wheel(s).
(d) Assignment of Criminal Cases.
(1) There shall be a Brooklyn criminal and a Long Island criminal assignment wheel.
(2) There shall be a Brooklyn and Long Island criminal misdemeanor assignment
wheels for the random assignment of these matters to a magistrate.
(e) Place of Trial.
Except in emergencies a case shall be tried at the place to which it has been assigned.
(f) Objection.
Any objection by a party to designation of a judge or to place of trial shall be made by letter
or motion to the judge assigned
(1) in a criminal case, within fourteen (14) days from arraignment or from initial
notice of appearance, whichever is earlier; or
(2) in a civil case, within the time allowed to respond to the complaint.
(g) Special Cases.
(1) The miscellaneous judge shall send all narcotics addict commitment cases
involving "eligible individuals" as defined by 28 U.S.C. § 2901(g) to the clerk for assignment
as provided in paragraph (b).
(2) Pro se applications or claims by persons in custody shall be filed without
prepayment of fees upon receipt, prior to decision on their in forma pauperis petitions.
(3) Multidistrict litigation is to be assigned to the judge selected by the multidistrict
litigation panel; subject to reassignment by the Chief Judge of the Eastern District of New
York, according to the usual reassignment rules of the district, to adjust caseload distribution
in the interests of justice.
(h) Chief Judge; Senior Judges; Temporarily Overloaded Judges; Notice of Removal from
Wheel.
The chief judge and each senior judge shall indicate from time to time to the clerk the
percentage of a full caseload that he or she elects to have assigned. The chief judge, with the
consent of a judge, may remove that judge from any wheel temporarily to reduce the number of
pending cases and prevent delay in the disposition of cases by a judge who is then overburdened by
cases or due to ill health. The chief judge shall return that judge to the wheel only on consent of the
judge. The clerk shall upon request inform any attorney or party of the identity of judges whose
names have been removed from a wheel.
(i) Visiting Judge.
The chief judge shall approve the assignment or transfer of cases to a visiting judge.
(j) Proceedings After Assignment.
All proceedings in a case after assignment shall be conducted by the assigned judge, except as
provided by these guidelines.
(k) Recusal.
A judge or magistrate judge may recuse himself or herself at any time in accordance with
U.S.C. § 455. This guideline takes precedence over any other guideline.
(l) Appeals-Assignment on Reversal or Remand.
(1) In a criminal case upon reversal of a judgment and a direction for retrial or
resentence, on receipt of the mandate of the appellate court the clerk shall randomly select a
different judge to preside over the case. Notwithstanding this provision the chief judge may
order the case assigned to the original presiding judge to avoid placing an excessive burden on
another judge.
(2) In a civil case upon reversal the case shall remain assigned to the judge who was
previously assigned, unless the chief judge or his designee orders otherwise.
[Amended: January 10th, 2012]

50.3.1 Related Civil Cases
(a) “Related” Civil Case Defined. A civil case is “related” to another civil case for
purposes of this guideline when, because of the similarity of facts and legal issues or because the
cases arise from the same transactions or events, a substantial saving of judicial resources is likely to
result from assigning both cases to the same judge and magistrate judge.
(b) Civil Cases Not Deemed “Related”. A civil case shall not be deemed “related” to
another civil case merely because the civil case: (A) involves identical legal issues, or (B) involves the 
same parties.
(c) Civil Cases Presumptively Not “Related”: Unless Both Cases Are Still
Pending.
Presumptively, and subject to the power of a judge to determine otherwise pursuant to
paragraph (d), civil cases shall not be deemed to be “related” unless both cases are still pending
before the court.
(d) Judicial Determination That Civil Cases Are “Related”. Except for the cases
described in the final sentence of paragraph (e), all civil cases shall be randomly assigned when they
are filed. Other than the cases described in the final sentence of paragraph (e), civil cases shall not
be deemed to be “related” for purposes of this guideline at the instance of any litigant or attorney
unless and until there has been a determination by a judge of this court that the standard of
paragraph (a) is met, i.e., that because of the similarity of facts and legal issues or because the cases
arise from the same transactions or events, a substantial saving of judicial resources is likely to result
from assigning both cases to the same judge and magistrate judge. Any party may apply for such a
determination by filing with the clerk a letter of no more than three single-spaced pages explaining
why the standard of paragraph (a) is met and serving copies of the letter on all other parties. Such
an application must be made after the date when at least a majority of the defendants have been
served with the complaint, but not more than 30 days after that date unless the judge passing on the
application permits a later filing for good cause shown. Before making such an application, the
applicant must confer in good faith with all other parties in an effort to reach an agreement on
whether or not the case is “related”. After such an application is made, any other party may serve
and file within seven (7) days a letter of no more than three single-spaced pages supporting or
opposing the application. Any determination by a judge of this court that the standard of paragraph
(a) is or is not met shall be made by a judge or judges designated by the chief judge, who shall not
include the judge to whom the case has been randomly assigned or the judge to whom the case will 
be assigned if it is determined to be “related”.
(e) Assignment of Related Cases. Cases which have been judicially determined to
be related shall be assigned by the clerk to the judge to whom was assigned the case with the lowest
docket number in the series of related cases. The clerk shall advise the judge of such assignment of
a related case. In the interest of judicial economy, the following categories of civil cases shall be
deemed to be “related” without further order of the court: (1) all habeas corpus petitions filed by the
same petitioner; (2) all pro se civil actions filed by the same individual; and (3) any other
subject-matter category of cases where the chief judge finds that the standard of paragraph (a) is met.
(f) No Vested Rights. As stated in the Introduction to these Division of Business
Rules, this rule is adopted for the internal management of the case load of the court and shall not be
deemed to vest any rights in litigants or their attorneys and shall be subject to such amendments from
time to time as shall be approved by the court. This rule shall not be deemed to prevent the
reassignment of cases at the initiative of and by agreement of the judges involved.
[Amended: September 22, 2008]

50.3.2 Related Criminal Cases
(a) In General
(1) For purposes of this rule, a “case” refers to a criminal proceeding commenced
by indictment or information. It does not include wiretap applications, motions in connection
with grand jury proceedings, or ex parte motions made outside of a proceeding commenced
by indictment or information.
(2) All criminal cases shall be randomly assigned upon filing.
(3) This rule shall not be deemed to prevent the reassignment of cases at the
initiative of and by agreement of the judges involved.
(4) As stated in the Introduction to these Division of Business Rules, this rule is 
adopted for the internal management of the case load of the court and shall not be deemed to
vest any rights in litigants or their attorneys and shall be subject to such amendments from
time to time as shall be approved by the court.
(b) Relevant Considerations in Relating Cases
(1) There shall be a presumption that one case is “related” to another when the
facts of each arise out of the same charged criminal scheme(s), transaction(s), or event(s),
even if different defendants are involved in each case.
(2) The presumption shall be overcome upon a determination by the relevant
judges that reassignment would not achieve a significant savings of judicial resources or serve
the interests of justice.
(3) In a case involving racketeering charges, the determination of whether that
case should be related to another shall be made on the basis of the predicate acts charged, not
the criminal enterprise.
(4) If a defendant has been convicted in more than one case and the sentences
are pending before different judges, each of the pending sentences shall be imposed by a
single judge determined by all of the relevant judges to be best suited to do so.
(c) Obligation of the United States Attorney’s Office
(1) It is the affirmative obligation of the United States Attorney’s Office
(“USAO”) to give notice to all relevant judges whenever it appears that one case may be
presumptively related to another pursuant to Section (b)(1). Such notice shall be by letter and
filed together with the indictment, information or Federal Criminal Rule 7(b) motion and
addressed to each of the judges concerned. The letter shall set forth the facts relevant to
deciding whether the indictment or information should be related to another case. The letter
shall in addition state clearly whether its purpose is solely to provide notice to the Court
under this rule, or whether the USAO seeks reassignment.
(2) The USAO may move for leave to file a notice required by the rule ex parte
and under seal for good cause shown. The USAO shall promptly move to unseal the notice
once the need for ex parte and sealed filing no longer exists. Absent leave of court, the USAO
shall publicly file a notice indicating that an ex parte sealed filing pursuant to this rule is being
submitted.
(3) These obligations are continuing. The USAO should endeavor to provide
notice that could avoid having two or more judges sentence different defendants or the same
defendant in related cases.
(d) Input from Defendants
Any defendant may request reassignment to a judge whom the defendant contends
has a case that is presumptively related pursuant to Section (b)(1). In addition, any defendant
may request that a case previously assigned to a judge as related be reassigned to the original
judge on the ground that it was not properly related. Such requests shall be made by filed
letter in both cases, addressed to both judges.
(e) Joint Application for Reassignment
Nothing in this rule shall preclude the USAO and defendant from jointly seeking
reassignment to another judge in the interests of justice or on the grounds that a significant
savings of judicial resources would be achieved. 

50.4 Reassignment of Cases
No case shall be reassigned except in the interest of justice and the efficient disposition of the
business of the court. The chief judge may at any time, with the consent of the judges involved,
reassign individual cases. Reassignment of cases to accommodate changes in the complement of
judges shall be made in accordance with the order of the Board of Judges.

50.5 Miscellaneous Judge and Duty Magistrate Judge
(a) Duties and Functions of the Miscellaneous Judge
(1) All matters, including those requiring immediate action or brought as special proceedings
which cannot be assigned in the ordinary course, shall be randomly assigned pursuant to the
procedures set forth in 50.2(b) of these rules.
(2) The miscellaneous judge shall hear and determine matters requiring immediate action in
cases already assigned to any judge of the court, if that judge is unavailable or otherwise unable to hear
the matter only for such immediate emergency action. The matter or case will remain assigned to the
judge originally selected at random.
(3) The miscellaneous judge shall preside over admissions to the bar and naturalization
proceedings.
(b) Duties and Functions of the Duty Magistrate Judge

(3) Decide requests to be excused from service on the grand and petit juries; and
(4) Preside over admissions to the bar and naturalization proceedings when requested.
(c) Limitation of Duties in Matters Already Assigned.
The miscellaneous judge shall dispose of matters under paragraph (a)(2) only to the extent necessary
and shall continue the case before the assigned judge. All applications for emergency action or relief
shall disclose any prior application to a judge for the same or related relief and the outcome thereof.

50.6 Calendars
(a) Numbers; Order of Cases.
The docket number of each case shall be the calendar number. No note of issue shall be
required to place the case on the calendar. Each judge shall dispose of cases assigned to him or her
as required by law and the efficient administration of justice.
(b) Preferences.
Each judge shall schedule cases appearing on his or her docket in such order as seems just
and appropriate, giving preference to the processing and disposition of the following:
(1) habeas corpus petitions and motions attacking a federal sentence;
(2) Proceedings involving recalcitrant witnesses before federal courts or grand
juries, under 28 U.S.C. § 1846;
(3) Actions for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief; and
(4) Any other action if good cause is shown.
(c) Publication of Calendars.
Each court day the clerk shall post on bulletin boards throughout the courthouse and provide
to legal newspapers for publication copies of the judges' calendars.

informally, to entertain oral motions, to discuss settlement, or to set a schedule for the events in the
case, including completion of discovery, pretrial and trial.
