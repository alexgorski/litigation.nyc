###Local Patent Rule 1. Application of Rules
(a) These Local Patent Rules apply to patent infringement, validity and unenforceability
actions and proceedings. The Court may modify the obligations or deadlines set forth in these
Local Patent Rules based on the circumstances of any particular case, including, without
limitation, the simplicity or complexity of the case as shown by the patents, claims,
technology, products, or parties involved.

(b) The Local Civil Rules also apply to such actions and proceedings, except to the extent
they are inconsistent with these Local Patent Rules.

###Local Patent Rule 2. Initial Scheduling Conference
When the parties confer pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f), in addition to the matters covered by
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26, the parties must discuss and address in the report filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
26(f):

  * i. any proposed modification of the deadlines or proceedings set forth in these Local
Patent Rules;
  * ii. proposed format of and deadlines for claim construction filings and proceedings,
including a proposal for any expert discovery the parties propose to take in connection therewith;
and
  * iii. proposed format of and deadlines for service of infringement, invalidity and/or
unenforceability contentions, including any proposed deadlines for supplementation thereof.

###Local Patent Rule 3. Certification of Disclosures
All statements, disclosures, or charts filed or served in accordance with these Local Patent
Rules are deemed disclosures subject to Rule 26(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

###Local Patent Rule 4. Admissibility of Disclosures
Statements, disclosures or charts governed by these Local Patent Rules are admissible to the
extent permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence or Civil Procedure. However, the statements and
disclosures provided for in Local Patent Rule 11 are not admissible for any purpose other than in
connection with motions seeking an extension or modification of the time periods within which
actions contemplated by these Local Patent Rules shall be taken.

###Local Patent Rule 5. Discovery Objections Based on Local Patent Rules
A party may object to a mandatory disclosure under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) or to a discovery
request as conflicting with or premature under these Local Patent Rules only if the mandatory
disclosure or discovery request would require disclosure of information of the kind dealt with by
Local Patent Rules 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12.

###Local Patent Rule 6. Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Infringement Contentions
Unless otherwise specified by the Court, not later than forty-five (45) days after the Initial
Scheduling Conference, a party claiming patent infringement must serve on all parties a “Disclosure
of Asserted Claims and Infringement Contentions,” which identifies for each opposing party, each
claim of each patent-in-suit that is allegedly infringed and each product or process of each opposing
party of which the party claiming infringement is aware that allegedly infringes each identified claim.

###Local Patent Rule 7. Invalidity Contentions
Unless otherwise specified by the Court, not later than forty-five (45) days after service of the
“Disclosure of Asserted Claims and Infringement Contentions,” each party opposing a claim of
patent infringement must serve upon all parties its “Invalidity Contentions,” if any. Invalidity
Contentions must identify each item of prior art that the party contends allegedly anticipates or
renders obvious each asserted claim, and any other grounds of invalidity, including any under 35
U.S.C. § 101 or § 112, or unenforceability of any of the asserted claims.

###Local Patent Rule 8. Disclosure Requirement in Patent Cases Initiated by Declaratory Judgment
In all cases in which a party files a pleading seeking a declaratory judgment that a patent is not
infringed, is invalid, or is unenforceable, Local Patent Rule 6 shall not apply with respect to such
patent unless and until a claim for patent infringement of such patent is made by a party. If a party
does not assert a claim for patent infringement in its answer to the declaratory judgment pleading,
unless otherwise specified in the Court’s Scheduling Order, the party seeking a declaratory judgment
must serve upon all parties its Invalidity Contentions with respect to such patent that conform to
Local Patent Rule 7 not later than forty-five (45) days after the Initial Scheduling Conference.

###Local Patent Rule 9. Duty to Supplement Contentions
The duty to supplement in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e) shall apply to the Infringement Contentions
and the Invalidity Contentions required by Local Patent Rules 6 and 7.

###Local Patent Rule 10. Opinion of Counsel
Not later than thirty (30) days after entry of an order ruling on claim construction, each party
that will rely on an opinion of counsel as part of a defense to a claim
of willful infringement or inducement of infringement, or that a case is exceptional, must produce
or make available for inspection and copying the opinion(s) and any other documents relating to the
opinion(s) as to which attorney-client or work product protection has been waived as a result of such
production.

###Local Patent Rule 11. Joint Claim Terms Chart
By a date specified by the Court, the parties shall cooperate and jointly file a Joint Disputed

invalidity and/or infringement contention(s) disclosures under Local Rules 6 and 7.

(a) Not later than thirty (30) days after filing of the Joint Disputed Claim Terms Chart
