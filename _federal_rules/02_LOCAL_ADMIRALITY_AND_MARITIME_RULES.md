###Local Admiralty Rule E.2. Intervenors' Claims
(a) __Presentation of Claim.__ When a vessel or other property has been arrested, attached,
or garnished, and is in the hands of the marshal or custodian substituted therefor, anyone having a
claim against the vessel or property is required to present the claim by filing an intervening complaint,
and not by filing an original complaint, unless otherwise ordered by a judicial officer. Upon the
satisfaction of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, the clerk shall forthwith
deliver a conformed copy of the complaint to the marshal, who shall deliver the copy to the vessel or
custodian of the property. Intervenors shall thereafter be subject to the rights and obligations of
parties, and the vessel or property shall stand arrested, attached, or garnished by the intervenor.

(b) __Sharing Marshal's Fees and Expenses.__ An intervenor shall have a responsibility to
the first plaintiff, enforceable on motion, consisting of the intervenor's share of the marshal's fees
and expenses in the proportion that the intervenor's claim bears to the sum of all the claims. If a
party plaintiff permits vacation of an arrest, attachment, or garnishment, remaining plaintiffs share
the responsibility to the marshal for the fees and expenses in proportion to the remaining claims and
for the duration of the marshal's custody because of each claim.

###Local Admiralty Rule E.3. Claims by Suppliers for Payment of Charges
A person who furnishes supplies or services to a vessel, cargo, or other property in custody of
the court who has not been paid and claims the right to payment as an expense of administration
shall submit an invoice to the clerk in the form of a verified claim at any time before the vessel, cargo
or other property is released or sold. The supplier must serve copies of the claim on the marshal,
substitute custodian if one has been appointed, and all parties of record. The court may consider
the claims individually or schedule a single hearing for all claims.

###Local Admiralty Rule E.4. Preservation of Property
Whenever property is attached or arrested pursuant to the provisions of Supplemental
Rule E(4)(b) that permit the marshal or other person having the warrant to execute the process
without taking actual possession of the property, and the owner or occupant of the property is
thereby permitted to remain in possession, the court, on motion of any party or on its own motion,
may enter any order necessary to preserve the value of the property, its contents, and any income
derived therefrom, and to prevent the destruction, removal or diminution in value of such property,
contents and income.
