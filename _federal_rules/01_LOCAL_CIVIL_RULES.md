###Local Civil Rule 1.1. Application of Rules
These Local Civil Rules apply in all civil actions and proceedings governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

###Local Civil Rule 1.2. Night Depository
A night depository with an automatic date stamp shall be maintained by the Clerk of the Southern District in the Pearl Street Courthouse and by the Clerk of the Eastern District in the Brooklyn Courthouse. After regular business hours, papers for the District Court only may be deposited in the night depository. Such papers will be considered as having been filed in the District Court as of the date stamped thereon, which shall be deemed presumptively correct.

###Local Civil Rule 1.3. Admission to the Bar
(a) A member in good standing of the bar of the State of New York, or a member in good
standing of the bar of the United States District Court in Connecticut or Vermont and of the bar of
the State in which such district court is located, provided such district court by its rule extends a corresponding privilege to members of the bar of this Court, may be admitted to practice in this
Court on compliance with the following provisions:

In the first instance, each applicant for admission is required to file an application for
admission in electronic form on the Court's Web site. This one application will be utilized both to
admit and then to provide the applicant to the bar of this Court with a password and login for use
on the Court's Electronic Case Filing (ECF) system. The applicant shall adhere to all applicable
rules of admission.

The applicant shall (a) complete the application on-line, (b) submit the application
electronically, (c) print and sign a copy of the application, and (d) file the printed application and fee
with the Clerk, together with a certificate(s) of good standing and a supporting affidavit(s).

After submitting the application in electronic form, each applicant for admission shall file
with the Clerk, at least ten (10) days prior to hearing (unless, for good cause shown, the Judge shall
shorten the time), the signed paper copy of the verified written petition for admission stating: (1)
applicant's residence and office address; (2) the time when, and courts where, admitted; (3)
applicant's legal training and experience; (4) whether applicant has ever been held in contempt of
court, and, if so, the nature of the contempt and the final disposition thereof; (5) whether applicant
has ever been censured, suspended, disbarred or denied admission or readmission by any court, and,
if so, the facts and circumstances connected therewith; (6) that applicant has read and is familiar 
with (a) the provisions of the Judicial Code (Title 28, U.S.C.) which pertain to the jurisdiction of, and
practice in, the United States District Courts; (b) the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (c) the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (d) the Federal Rules of Evidence; (e) the Local Rules of the
United States District Courts for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York; and (f) the New
York State Rules of Professional Conduct as adopted from time to time by the Appellate Divisions
of the State of New York; and (7) that applicant will faithfully adhere to all rules applicable to
applicant's conduct in connection with any activities in this Court.

The petition shall be accompanied by a certificate of the clerk of the court for each of the
states in which the applicant is a member of the bar, which has been issued within thirty (30) days of
filing and states that the applicant is a member in good standing of the bar of that state court. The
petition shall also be accompanied by an affidavit of an attorney of this Court who has known the
applicant for at least one year, stating when the affiant was admitted to practice in this Court, how
long and under what circumstances the attorney has known the applicant, and what the attorney
knows of the applicant's character and experience at the bar. Such petition shall be placed at the
head of the calendar and, on the call thereof, the attorney whose affidavit accompanied the petition
shall personally move the admission of the applicant. If the petition is granted, the applicant shall
take the oath of office and sign the roll of attorneys.

A member of the bar of the state of New York, Connecticut, or Vermont who has been
admitted to the bar of this Court pursuant to this subsection and who thereafter voluntarily resigns
from membership in the bar of the state pursuant to which he was admitted to the bar of this Court,
and who does not within 30 days of that voluntary resignation file an affidavit with the Clerk of this
Court indicating that such person remains eligible to be admitted to the bar of this Court pursuant
to other provisions of this subsection (such as because he is still a member of the bar of another
eligible state and, where applicable, a corresponding district court), shall be deemed to have
voluntarily resigned from the bar of this Court as of the same date the member resigned from the 
bar of the underlying state, provided that such resignation shall not be deemed to deprive this Court
of jurisdiction to impose discipline on this person, pursuant to Rule 1.5 infra, for conduct preceding
the date of such resignation.

(b) A member in good standing of the bar of either the Southern or Eastern District of
New York may be admitted to the bar of the other district without formal application (1) upon filing
in that district a certificate of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the district in which
the applicant is a member of the bar, which has been issued within thirty (30) days of filing and
states that the applicant is a member in good standing of the bar of that Court and (2) upon taking
the oath of office, signing the roll of attorneys of that district, and paying the fee required in that
district.

(c) A member in good standing of the bar of any state or of any United States District
Court may be permitted to argue or try a particular case in whole or in part as counsel or advocate,
upon motion (which may be made by the applicant) and upon filing with the Clerk of the District
Court a certificate of the court for each of the states in which the applicant is a member of the bar,
which has been issued within thirty (30) days of filing and states that the applicant is a member in
good standing of the bar of that state court, and upon paying the required fee. Attorneys appearing
for the Department of Justice may appear before the Court without requesting pro hac vice
admission. Attorneys appearing for other federal agencies must move for pro hac vice admission but
the fee requirement is waived and the certificate(s) of good standing may have been issued within
one year of filing. Only an attorney who has been so admitted or who is a member of the bar of this
Court may enter appearances for parties, sign stipulations or receive payments upon judgments,
decrees or orders.

(d) If an attorney who is a member of the bar of this Court, or who has been authorized to
appear in a case in this Court, changes his or her residence or office address, the attorney shall
immediately notify the Clerk of the Court, in addition to serving and filing a notice of change of
address in each pending case in which the attorney has appeared. 

###Local Civil Rule 1.4. Withdrawal or Displacement of Attorney of Record
An attorney who has appeared as attorney of record for a party may be relieved or displaced
only by order of the Court and may not withdraw from a case without leave of the Court granted by
order. Such an order may be granted only upon a showing by affidavit or otherwise of satisfactory
reasons for withdrawal or displacement and the posture of the case, including its position, if any, on
the calendar, and whether or not the attorney is asserting a retaining or charging lien. All
applications to withdraw must be served upon the client and (unless excused by the Court) upon all
other parties.

###Local Civil Rule 1.5. Discipline of Attorneys
(a) Committee on Grievances. The Chief Judge shall appoint a committee of the Board
of Judges known as the Committee on Grievances, which under the direction of the Chief Judge
shall have charge of all matters relating to the discipline of attorneys. The Chief Judge shall
appoint a panel of attorneys who are members of the bar of this Court to advise or assist the
Committee on Grievances. At the direction of the Committee on Grievances or its chair, members
of this panel of attorneys may investigate complaints, may prepare and support statements of
charges, or may serve as members of hearing panels.

(b) Grounds for Discipline or Other Relief. Discipline or other relief, of the types set
forth in paragraph (c) below, may be imposed, by the Committee on Grievances, after notice and
opportunity to respond as set forth in paragraph (d) below, if any of the following grounds is found
by clear and convincing evidence:

  * (1) Any member of the bar of this Court has been convicted of a felony or
misdemeanor in any federal court, or in a court of any state or territory.
  * (2) Any member of the bar of this Court has been disciplined by any federal court
or by a court of any state or territory.
  * (3) Any member of the bar of this Court has resigned from the bar of any federal
court or of a court of any state or territory while an investigation into allegations of
misconduct by the attorney was pending.
  * (4) Any member of the bar of this Court has an infirmity which prevents the
attorney from engaging in the practice of law.
  * (5) In connection with activities in this Court, any attorney is found to have
engaged in conduct violative of the New York State Rules of Professional Conduct as 
adopted from time to time by the Appellate Divisions of the State of New York. In
interpreting the Code, in the absence of binding authority from the United States Supreme
Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, this Court, in the
interests of comity and predictability, will give due regard to decisions of the New York
Court of Appeals and other New York State courts, absent significant federal interests.
  * (6) Any attorney not a member of the bar of this Court has appeared at the bar of
this Court without permission to do so.

(c) Types of Discipline or Other Relief.

  * (1) In the case of an attorney admitted to the bar of this Court, discipline imposed
pursuant to paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(5) above may consist of a letter of
reprimand or admonition, censure, suspension, or an order striking the name of the attorney
from the roll of attorneys admitted to the bar of this Court.
  * (2) In the case of an attorney not admitted to the bar of this Court, discipline
imposed pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) or (b)(6) above may consist of a letter of reprimand or
admonition, censure, or an order precluding the attorney from again appearing at the bar of
this Court.
  * (3) Relief required pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) above shall consist of suspending
the attorney from practice before this Court.

(d) Procedure.

  * (1) If it appears that there exists a ground for discipline set forth in paragraph
(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3), notice thereof shall be served by the Committee on Grievances upon
the attorney concerned by first class mail, directed to the address of the attorney as shown
on the rolls of this Court and to the last known address of the attorney (if any) as shown in 
the complaint and any materials submitted therewith. Service shall be deemed complete
upon mailing in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
  * In all cases in which any federal court or a court of any state or territory has entered
an order disbarring or censuring an attorney or suspending the attorney from practice,
whether or not on consent, the notice shall be served together with an order by the Clerk of
this Court, to become effective twenty-four days after the date of service upon the attorney,
disbarring or censuring the attorney or suspending the attorney from practice in this Court
upon terms and conditions comparable to those set forth by the other court of record. In 
all cases in which an attorney has resigned from the bar of any federal court or of a court of
any state or territory while an investigation into allegations of misconduct by the attorney
was pending, even if the attorney remains admitted to the bar of any other court, the notice
shall be served together with an order entered by the Clerk for this Court, to become
effective twenty-four days after the date of service upon the attorney, deeming the attorney
to have resigned from the bar of this Court. Within twenty days of the date of service of
either order, the attorney may file a motion for modification or revocation of the order.
Any such motion shall set forth with specificity the facts and principles relied upon by the 
attorney as showing cause why a different disposition should be ordered by this Court.
The timely filing of such a motion will stay the effectiveness of the order until further order
by this Court. If good cause is shown to hold an evidentiary hearing, the Committee on
Grievances may direct such a hearing pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) below. If good cause is
not shown to hold an evidentiary hearing, the Committee on Grievances may proceed to
impose discipline or to take such other action as justice and this rule may require. If an
evidentiary hearing is held, the Committee may direct such interim relief pending the hearing 
as justice may require.
  * In all other cases, the notice shall be served together with an order by the Committee
on Grievances directing the attorney to show cause in writing why discipline should not be
imposed. If the attorney fails to respond in writing to the order to show cause, or if the
response fails to show good cause to hold an evidentiary hearing, the Committee on
Grievances may proceed to impose discipline or to take such other action as justice and this
rule may require. If good cause is shown to hold an evidentiary hearing, the Committee on
Grievances may direct such a hearing pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) below. If an evidentiary
hearing is held, the Committee may direct such interim relief pending the hearing as justice
may require.
  * (2) In the case of a ground for discipline set forth in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)
above, discipline may be imposed unless the attorney concerned establishes by clear and
convincing evidence (i) that there was such an infirmity of proof of misconduct by the
attorney as to give rise to the clear conviction that this Court could not consistent with its
duty accept as final the conclusion of the other court, or (ii) that the procedure resulting in
the investigation or discipline of the attorney by the other court was so lacking in notice or
opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process, or (iii) that the
imposition of discipline by this Court would result in grave injustice.
  * (3) Complaints in writing alleging any ground for discipline or other relief set forth
in paragraph (b) above shall be directed to the Chief Judge, who shall refer such complaints
to the Committee on Grievances. The Committee on Grievances, by its chair, may
designate an attorney, who may be selected from the panel of attorneys established pursuant
to paragraph (a) above, to investigate the complaint, if it deems investigation necessary or
warranted, and to prepare a statement of charges, if the Committee deems that necessary or
warranted. Complaints, and any files based on them, shall be treated as confidential unless 
otherwise ordered by the Chief Judge for good cause shown.
  * (4) A statement of charges alleging a ground for discipline or other relief set forth
in paragraph (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6) shall be served upon the attorney concerned by certified
mail, return receipt requested, directed to the address of the attorney as shown on the rolls
of this Court and to the last known address of the attorney (if any) as shown in the
complaint and any materials submitted therewith, together with an order by the Committee
on Grievances directing the attorney to show cause in writing why discipline or other relief 
should not be imposed. Upon the respondent attorney's answer to the charges the matter
will be designated by the Committee on Grievances for a prompt evidentiary hearing before
a Magistrate Judge of the Court or before a panel of three attorneys, who may be selected
from the panel of attorneys established pursuant to paragraph (a) above. The Magistrate
Judge or panel of attorneys conducting the hearing may grant such pre-hearing discovery as
they determine to be necessary, shall hear witnesses called by the attorney supporting the
charges and by the respondent attorney, and may consider such other evidence included in
the record of the hearing as they deem relevant and material. The Magistrate Judge or panel of attorneys conducting the hearing shall report their findings and recommendations in writing to the Committee on Grievances and shall serve them upon the respondent attorney and the attorney supporting the charges. After affording the respondent attorney and the attorney supporting the charges an opportunity to respond in writing to such report, or if no timely answer is made by the respondent attorney, or if the Committee on Grievances determines that the answer raises no issue requiring a hearing, the Committee on Grievances may proceed to impose discipline or to take such action as justice and this rule may require.

(e) Reinstatement. Any attorney who has been suspended or precluded from appearing
in this Court or whose name has been struck from the roll of the members of the bar of this Court
may apply in writing to the Chief Judge, for good cause shown, for the lifting of the suspension or
preclusion or for reinstatement to the rolls. The Chief Judge shall refer such application to the
Committee on Grievances. The Committee on Grievances may refer the application to a
Magistrate Judge or hearing panel of attorneys (who may be the same Magistrate Judge or panel of
attorneys who previously heard the matter) for findings and recommendations, or may act upon the
application without making such a referral. Absent extraordinary circumstances, no such
application will be granted unless the attorney seeking reinstatement meets the requirements for admission set forth in Local Civil Rule 1.3(a). 

(f) Remedies for Misconduct. The remedies provided by this rule are in addition to the
remedies available to individual District Judges and Magistrate Judges under applicable law with
respect to lawyers appearing before them. Individual District Judges and Magistrate Judges may
also refer any matter to the Chief Judge for referral to the Committee on Grievances to consider the
imposition of discipline or other relief pursuant to this rule.

(g) Notice to Other Courts. When an attorney is known to be admitted to practice in the
court of any state or territory, or in any other federal court, and has been convicted of any crime or
disbarred, precluded from appearing, suspended or censured in this court, the Clerk shall send to 
such other court or courts a certified or electronic copy of the judgment of conviction or order of
disbarment, preclusion, suspension or censure, a certified or electronic copy of the Court's opinion,
if any, and a statement of the attorney's last known office and residence address.

(h) Duty of Attorney to Report Discipline.

  * (1) In all cases in which any federal, state or territorial court, agency or tribunal has entered an order
disbarring or censuring an attorney admitted to the bar of this Court, or
suspending the attorney from practice, whether or not on consent, the attorney shall deliver
a copy of said order to the Clerk of this Court within fourteen days after the entry of the
order.
  * (2) In all cases in which any member of the bar of this Court has resigned from the
bar of any federal, state or territorial court, agency or tribunal while an investigation into
allegations of misconduct against the attorney was pending, the attorney shall report such
resignation to the Clerk of this Court within fourteen days after the submission of the resignation.
  * (3) In all cases in which this Court has entered an order disbarring or censuring an
attorney, or suspending the attorney from practice, whether or not on consent, the attorney
shall deliver a copy of said order within fourteen days after the entry of the order to the clerk
of each federal, state or territorial court, agency and tribunal in which such attorney has been
admitted to practice.
  * (4) Any failure of an attorney to comply with the requirements of this Local Civil
Rule 1.5(h) shall constitute a basis for discipline of said attorney pursuant to Local Civil Rule
1.5(c).

###Local Civil Rule 1.6. Duty of Attorneys in Related Cases
(a) It shall be the continuing duty of each attorney appearing in any civil or criminal case to
bring promptly to the attention of the Court all facts which said attorney believes are relevant to a
determination that said case and one or more pending civil or criminal cases should be heard by the
same Judge, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of judicial effort. As soon as the attorney
becomes aware of such relationship, said attorney shall notify the Judges to whom the cases have
been assigned.

(b) If counsel fails to comply with Local Civil Rule 1.6(a), the Court may assess reasonable
costs directly against counsel whose action has obstructed the effective administration of the Court's
business.

###Local Civil Rule 1.7. Fees of Court Clerks and Reporters
(a) The Clerk shall not be required to render any service for which a fee is prescribed by
statute or by the Judicial Conference of the United States unless the fee for the particular service is
paid to the Clerk in advance or the Court orders otherwise.

(b) Every attorney appearing in any proceeding who orders a transcript of any trial,
hearing, or any other proceeding, is obligated to pay the cost thereof to the court reporters of the
Court upon rendition of the invoice unless at the time of such order, the attorney, in writing, advises
the court reporter that only the client is obligated to pay.

###Local Civil Rule 1.8. Photographs, Radio, Recordings, Television
Unless authorized to do so by an administrative order of each respective Court, no one other
than Court officials engaged in the conduct of Court business shall bring any camera, transmitter,
receiver, recording device, cellular telephone, computer or other electronic device into any
courthouse.

###Local Civil Rule 1.9. Acceptable Substitutes for Affidavits [formerly Local Civil Rule 1.10]
In situations in which any Local Rule provides for an affidavit or a verified statement, the
following are acceptable substitutes: (a) a statement subscribed under penalty of perjury as
prescribed in 28 U.S.C. `§ 1746; or (b) if accepted by the Court as a substitute for an affidavit or a
verified statement, (1) a statement signed by an attorney or by a party not represented by an attorney

disclosure materials, together with the responses and objections thereto, that are the subject of the
discovery motion or application, or that are cited in papers submitted in connection with any other
motion or application. See also Civil Local Rule 37.1.

###Local Civil Rule 5.2. Electronic Service and Filing of Documents

York.

(b) Subject to the instructions regarding ECF published on the website of each
respective Court and any pertinent Individual Judge's Practices, letter-motions permitted by Local

Service upon an attorney may be made by overnight delivery service. “Overnight delivery

###Local Civil Rule 6.1. Service and Filing of Motion Papers

###Local Civil Rule 6.2. Orders on Motions
A memorandum signed by the Court of the decision on a motion that does not finally
determine all claims for relief, or an oral decision on such a motion, shall constitute the order unless
the memorandum or oral decision directs the submission or settlement of an order in more
extended form. The notation in the docket of a memorandum or of an oral decision that does not
direct the submission or settlement of an order in more extended form shall constitute the entry of
the order. Where an order in more extended form is required to be submitted or settled, the
notation in the docket of such order shall constitute the entry of the order. 

###Local Civil Rule 6.3. Motions for Reconsideration or Reargument
Unless otherwise provided by the Court or by statute or rule (such as Fed. R. Civ. P. 50, 52,

###Local Civil Rule 7.2. Authorities to Be Provided to Pro Se Litigants
In cases involving a pro se litigant, counsel shall, when serving a memorandum of law (or other
submissions to the Court), provide the pro se litigant (but not other counsel or the Court) with copies
of cases and other authorities cited therein that are unpublished or reported exclusively on
computerized databases. Upon request, counsel shall provide the pro se litigant with copies of such
unpublished cases and other authorities as are cited in a decision of the Court and were not previously
cited by any party.

###Local Civil Rule 7.1.1 Disclosure Statement
For purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 7.1(b)(2), “promptly” shall mean “within fourteen days,” that
is, parties are required to file a supplemental disclosure statement within fourteen days of the time
there is any change in the information required in a disclosure statement filed pursuant to those rules.

###Local Civil Rule 11.1. Form of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers
(a) Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must (1) be plainly written, typed,
printed, or copied without erasures or interlineations which materially deface it, (2) bear the docket

following requirements: (1) all text must be 12-point type or larger, except for text in footnotes
which may be 10-point type; (2) all documents must have at least one-inch margins on all sides; (3) all text must be double-spaced, except for headings, text in footnotes, or block quotations, which may be
single-spaced.

###Local Civil Rule 12.1. Notice to Pro Se Litigant Who Opposes a Rule 12 Motion Supported by Matters Outside the Pleadings

A represented party moving to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings against a party
proceeding pro se, who refers in support of the motion to matters outside the pleadings as described in
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) or 12(c), shall serve and file the following notice with the full text of Fed. R. Civ.
P. 56 attached at the time the motion is served. If the Court rules that a motion to dismiss or for
judgment on the pleadings will be treated as one for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56,
and the movant has not previously served and filed the notice required by this rule, the movant shall
amend the form notice to reflect that fact and shall serve and file the amended notice within fourteen days of the Court's ruling.

__Notice to Pro Se Litigant Who Opposes a Rule 12 Motion Supported by Matters Outside the
Pleadings__

The defendant in this case has moved to dismiss or for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to
Rule 12(b) or 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and has submitted additional written
materials. This means that the defendant has asked the Court to decide this case without a trial,
based on these written materials. You are warned that the Court may treat this motion as a motion
for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For this reason, THE
CLAIMS YOU ASSERT IN YOUR COMPLAINT MAY BE DISMISSED WITHOUT A TRIAL IF
YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS MOTION ON TIME by filing sworn affidavits as required by Rule 56(c) and/or other documents. The full text of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
is attached.

In short, Rule 56 provides that you may NOT oppose the defendant's motion simply by relying
upon the allegations in your complaint. Rather, you must submit evidence, such as witness
statements or documents, countering the facts asserted by the defendant and raising specific facts that support your claim. If you have proof of your claim, now is the time to submit it. Any witness
statements must be in the form of affidavits. An affidavit is a sworn statement of fact based on
personal knowledge stating facts that would be admissible in evidence at trial. You may submit your
own affidavit and/or the affidavits of others. You may submit affidavits that were prepared
specifically in response to defendant's motion.

If you do not respond to the motion on time with affidavits and/or documents contradicting
the facts asserted by the defendant, the Court may accept defendant's facts as true. Your case may be
dismissed and judgment may be entered in defendant's favor without a trial.
If you have any questions, you may direct them to the Pro Se Office.

###Local Civil Rule 16.1. Exemptions from Mandatory Scheduling Order
Matters involving habeas corpus petitions, social security disability cases, motions to vacate
sentences, forfeitures, and reviews from administrative agencies are exempted from the mandatory
scheduling order required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).

###Local Civil Rule 16.2. Entry and Modification of Mandatory Scheduling Orders by Magistrate Judges
In any case referred to a Magistrate Judge, the Magistrate Judge may issue or modify scheduling
orders pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).

###Local Civil Rule 23.1.1 Fees in Shareholder Derivative Actions
Fees for attorneys or others shall not be paid upon recovery or compromise in a derivative
action on behalf of a corporation except as allowed by the Court after a hearing upon such notice as
the Court may direct. The notice shall include a statement of the names and addresses of the
applicants for such fees and the amounts requested respectively and shall disclose any fee sharing
agreements with anyone. Where the Court directs notice of a hearing upon a proposed voluntary
dismissal or settlement of a derivative action, the above information as to the applications shall be
included in the notice.

###Local Civil Rule 26.1. Address of Party and Original Owner of Claim to Be Furnished
A party shall furnish to any other party, within seven (7) days after a demand, a verified
statement setting forth:

(a) If the responding party is a natural person, that party's residence and domicile, and any
state or other jurisdiction of which that party is a citizen for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1332;

(b) If the responding party is a partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability
company, or other unincorporated association, like information for all of its partners or members, as
well as the state or other jurisdiction of its formation;

(c) If the responding party is a corporation, its state or other jurisdiction of incorporation,
principal place of business, and any state or other jurisdiction of which that party is a citizen for
purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1332; and

(d) In the case of an assigned claim, corresponding information for each original owner of
the claim and for any assignee. 

###Local Civil Rule 26.2. Assertion of Claim of Privilege
(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or directed by the Court, where a claim of privilege
is asserted in objecting to any means of discovery or disclosure, including but not limited to a
deposition, and an answer is not provided on the basis of such assertion,

  * (1) The person asserting the privilege shall identify the nature of the privilege
(including work product) which is being claimed and, if the privilege is governed by state law,
indicate the state's privilege rule being invoked; and
  * (2) The following information shall be provided in the objection, or (in the case of a
deposition) in response to questions by the questioner, unless divulgence of such information 
would cause disclosure of the allegedly privileged information:
    * (A) For documents: (i) the type of document, e.g., letter or memorandum;
(ii) the general subject matter of the document; (iii) the date of the document; and (iv)
the author of the document, the addressees of the document, and any other recipients, 
and, where not apparent, the relationship of the author, addressees, and recipients to
each other;
    * (B) For oral communications: (i) the name of the person making the
communication and the names of persons present while the communication was made
and, where not apparent, the relationship of the persons present to the person making
the communication; (ii) the date and place of communication; and (iii) the general
subject matter of the communication.

(b) Where a claim of privilege is asserted in response to discovery or disclosure other than a
deposition, and information is not provided on the basis of such assertion, the information set forth in
paragraph (a) above shall be furnished in writing at the time of the response to such discovery or
disclosure, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

(c) Efficient means of providing information regarding claims of privilege are encouraged,
and parties are encouraged to agree upon measures that further this end. For example, when
asserting privilege on the same basis with respect to multiple documents, it is presumptively proper to
provide the information required by this rule by group or category. A party receiving a privilege log
that groups documents or otherwise departs from a document-by-document or
communication-by-communication listing may not object solely on that basis, but may object if the
substantive information required by this rule has not been provided in a comprehensible form. 

###Local Civil Rule 26.3. Uniform Definitions in Discovery Requests
(a) The full text of the definitions and rules of construction set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d)
is deemed incorporated by reference into all discovery requests. No discovery request shall use
broader definitions or rules of construction than those set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d). This rule
shall not preclude (1) the definition of other terms specific to the particular litigation, (2) the use of
abbreviations, or (3) a more narrow definition of a term defined in paragraph (c).

(b) This rule is not intended to broaden or narrow the scope of discovery permitted by the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

(c) The following definitions apply to all discovery requests:

  * (1) __Communication.__ The term “communication” means the transmittal of
information (in the form of facts, ideas, inquiries or otherwise).
  * (2) __Document.__ The term “document” is defined to be synonymous in meaning
and equal in scope to the usage of the term “documents or electronically stored information”
in Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a)(1)(A). A draft or non-identical copy is a separate document within the
meaning of this term. 
  * (3) __Identify (with respect to persons).__ When referring to a person, “to identify”
means to give, to the extent known, the person's full name, present or last known address, and
when referring to a natural person, additionally, the present or last known place of
employment. Once a person has been identified in accordance with this subparagraph, only
the name of that person need be listed in response to subsequent discovery requesting the
identification of that person.
  * (4) __Identify (with respect to documents).__ When referring to documents, “to
identify” means to give, to the extent known, the (i) type of document; (ii) general subject 
matter; (iii) date of the document; and (iv) author(s), addressee(s) and recipient(s). In the
alternative, the responding party may produce the documents, together with identifying
information sufficient to satisfy Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(d).
  * (5) __Parties.__ The terms “plaintiff” and “defendant” as well as a party's full or
abbreviated name or a pronoun referring to a party mean the party and, where applicable, its
officers, directors, employees, partners, corporate parent, subsidiaries or affiliates. This
definition is not intended to impose a discovery obligation on any person who is not a party to
the litigation. 
  * (6) __Person.__ The term “person” is defined as any natural person or any legal entity,
including, without limitation, any business or governmental entity or association.
  * (7) __Concerning.__ The term “concerning” means relating to, referring to, describing,
evidencing or constituting.

(d) The following rules of construction apply to all discovery requests:

  * (1) __All/Any/Each.__ The terms “all,” “any,” and “each” shall each be construed as
encompassing any and all.
  * (2) __And/Or.__ The connectives “and” and “or” shall be construed either disjunctively
or conjunctively as necessary to bring within the scope of the discovery request all responses
that might otherwise be construed to be outside of its scope.
  * (3) __Number.__ The use of the singular form of any word includes the plural and vice
versa.

###Local Civil Rule 26.4. Cooperation Among Counsel in Discovery [formerly Local Civil Rules 26.5 and 26.7]

(a) Counsel are expected to cooperate with each other, consistent with the interests of their
clients, in all phases of the discovery process and to be courteous in their dealings with each other,
including in matters relating to scheduling and timing of various discovery procedures.

(b) Discovery requests shall be read reasonably in the recognition that the attorney serving
them generally does not have the information being sought and the attorney receiving them generally
does have such information or can obtain it from the client.

###Local Civil Rule 26.5. Form Discovery Requests [formerly Local Civil Rule 26.6]
Attorneys using form discovery requests shall review them to ascertain that they are relevant to
the subject matter involved in the particular case. Discovery requests which are not relevant to the
subject matter involved in the particular case shall not be used.

###Local Civil Rule 30.1. Counsel Fees on Taking Depositions More Than 100 Miles From Courthouse
When a deposition upon oral examination is to be taken at a place more than one hundred
(100) miles from the courthouse, any party may request the Court to issue an order providing that
prior to the examination, another party shall pay the expense (including a reasonable counsel fee) of
the attendance of one attorney for each other party at the place where the deposition is to be taken.
The amounts so paid, unless otherwise directed by the Court, may be taxed as a cost at the conclusion
of the action or proceeding.

###Local Civil Rule 30.2. Telephonic and Other Remote Depositions [formerly Local Civil Rule 30.3]
The motion of a party to take the deposition of an adverse party by telephone or other remote
means will presumptively be granted. Where the opposing party is a corporation, the term “adverse
party” means an officer, director, managing agent or corporate designee pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
30(b)(6).

###Local Civil Rule 30.3. Persons Attending Depositions [formerly Local Civil Rule 30.4]
A person who is a party in the action may attend the deposition of a party or witness. A
witness or potential witness in the action may attend the deposition of a party or witness unless
otherwise ordered by the Court.

###Local Civil Rule 30.4. Conferences Between Deponent and Defending Attorney [formerly Local Civil Rule 30.6]
An attorney for a deponent shall not initiate a private conference with the deponent while a
deposition question is pending, except for the purpose of determining whether a privilege should be
asserted. 

###Local Civil Rule 33.2. Standard Discovery in Prisoner Pro Se Actions
(a) This rule shall apply in any action commenced pro se in which the plaintiff's complaint
includes any claim described in paragraph (b) of this rule, in which the events alleged in the
complaint occurred while the plaintiff was in the custody of the New York State Department of
Corrections & Community Supervision, the Department of Correction of the City of New York, or any
other jail, prison or correctional facility operated by or for a city, county, municipal or other local
governmental entity (collectively, the “Department”). Defendants represented by the Office of the
Attorney General, the Office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, or counsel for or
appointed by the Department responsible for the jail, prison or correctional facility (collectively, the
“Facility”), shall respond to the standing discovery requests adopted by the Court, in accordance with
the instructions and definitions set forth in the standing requests, unless otherwise ordered by the
Court.

(b) The claims to which the standard discovery requests shall apply are Use of Force Cases,
Inmate Against Inmate Assault Cases and Disciplinary Due Process Cases, as defined below.

  * (1) “Use of Force Case” refers to an action in which the complaint alleges that an
employee of the Department or Facility used physical force against the plaintiff in violation of
the plaintiff's rights.
  * (2) “Inmate against Inmate Assault Case” refers to an action in which the complaint
alleges that an employee of the Department or Facility was responsible for the plaintiff's injury
resulting from physical contact with another inmate.
  * (3) “Disciplinary Due Process Case” refers to an action in which (i) the complaint
alleges that an employee of the Department or Facility violated or permitted the violation of a
right or rights in a disciplinary proceeding against plaintiff, and (ii) the punishment imposed
upon plaintiff as a result of that proceeding was placement in a special housing unit for more
than 30 days.

(c) If a response to the requests is required to be made on behalf of an individual defendant
represented by the Office of the Corporation Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General or counsel for
or appointed by the Department responsible for the Facility, it shall be made on the basis of
information and documents within the possession, custody or control of the Department or Facility in
accordance with the instructions contained in the requests. If no defendant is represented by such
counsel, responses based upon such information need not be made pursuant to this Local Rule,
without prejudice to such other discovery procedures as the plaintiff shall initiate.

(d) The requests, denominated “Plaintiff's Local Civil Rule 33.2 Interrogatories and
Requests for Production of Documents,” shall be answered within 120 days of service of the
complaint on any named defendant except (i) as otherwise ordered by the Court, for good cause
shown, which shall be based upon the facts and procedural status of the particular case and not upon a
generalized claim of burden, expense or relevance or (ii) if a dispositive motion is pending. The
responses to the requests shall be served upon the plaintiff. Copies of the requests are available from the
Court, including the Court's website.

(e) Except upon permission of the Court, for good cause shown, the requests shall constitute the
sole form of discovery available to plaintiff during the 120-day period designated above.

(f) If the Clerk's Office determines that this rule applies, it shall provide copies of the
standard requests for service upon defendants together with the summons and complaint.

###Local Civil Rule 33.3. Interrogatories (Southern District Only)
(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery,
interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information
relevant to the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and
the existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.

(b) During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described in
paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method of obtaining the
information sought than a request for production or a deposition, or (2) if ordered by the Court.

(c) At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery cut-off
date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing party may be served unless
the Court has ordered otherwise. 

###Local Civil Rule 37.1. Verbatim Quotation of Discovery Materials
Upon any motion or application involving discovery or disclosure requests or responses
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37, the moving party shall specify and quote or set forth verbatim in the motion
papers each discovery request and response to which the motion or application is addressed. The
motion or application shall also set forth the grounds upon which the moving party is entitled to
prevail as to each request or response. Local Civil Rule 5.1 also applies to the motion or
application.

###Local Civil Rule 37.2. Mode of Raising Discovery Disputes With the Court (Southern District Only)
No motion under Rules 26 through 37 inclusive of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall
be heard unless counsel for the moving party has first requested an informal conference with the
Court by letter-motion for a pre-motion discovery conference (subject to the instructions regarding
ECF published on the Court's website and the Judge's Individual Practices) and such request has
either been denied or the discovery dispute has not been resolved as a consequence of such a
conference.

###Local Civil Rule 37.3. Mode of Raising Discovery and Other Non-Dispositive Pretrial Disputes With the Court (Eastern District Only)
(a) Good-Faith Effort to Resolve. Prior to seeking judicial resolution of a discovery or
non-dispositive pretrial dispute, the attorneys for the affected parties or non-party witness shall
attempt to confer in good faith in person or by telephone in an effort to resolve the dispute, in
conformity with Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1).

(b) Disputes Arising During Depositions. Where the attorneys for the affected parties
or a non-party witness cannot agree on a resolution of a discovery dispute that arises during a
deposition, they shall, to the extent practicable, notify the Court by telephone and seek a ruling while
the deposition is in progress. If a prompt ruling cannot be obtained, and the dispute involves an 
instruction to the witness not to answer a question, the instruction not to answer may stand and the
deposition shall continue until a ruling is obtained pursuant to the procedure set forth in paragraph
(c) below.

(c) Other Discovery and Non-Dispositive Pretrial Disputes. Where the attorneys for
the affected parties or non-party witness cannot agree on a resolution of any other discovery dispute
or non-dispositive pretrial dispute, or if they are unable to obtain a telephonic ruling on a discovery
dispute that arises during a deposition as provided in paragraph (b) above, they shall notify the Court
by letter not exceeding three pages in length outlining the nature of the dispute and attaching relevant
materials. Within four days of receiving such a letter, any opposing affected party or non-party 
witness may submit a responsive letter not exceeding three pages attaching relevant materials.
Except for the letters and attachments authorized herein, or where a ruling which was made
exclusively as a result of a telephone conference is the subject of de novo review pursuant to paragraph
(d) hereof, papers shall not be submitted with respect to a dispute governed by this rule unless the
Court has so directed.

(d) Motion for Reconsideration. A ruling made exclusively as a result of a telephone
conference may be the subject of de novo reconsideration by a letter not exceeding five pages in length 
attaching relevant materials submitted by any affected party or non-party witness. Within four days
of receiving such a letter, any other affected party or non-party witness may submit a responsive
letter not exceeding five pages in length attaching relevant materials.

(e) Decision of the Court. The Court shall record or arrange for the recording of the
Court's decision in writing. Such written order may take the form of an oral order read into the
record of a deposition or other proceeding, a handwritten memorandum, a handwritten marginal
notation on a letter or other document, or any other form the Court deems appropriate. 

###Local Civil Rule 39.1. Custody of Trial and Hearing Exhibits
(a) Unless the Court orders otherwise, trial and hearing exhibits shall not be filed with the
Clerk, but shall be retained in the custody of the respective attorneys who produced them in court.

(b) Trial and hearing exhibits which have been filed with the Clerk shall be removed by the
party responsible for them (1) if no appeal is taken, within ninety (90) days after a final decision is
rendered, or (2) if an appeal has been taken, within thirty (30) days after the final disposition of the
appeal. Parties failing to comply with this rule shall be notified by the Clerk to remove their exhibits
and upon their failure to do so within thirty (30) days, the Clerk may dispose of them as the Clerk
may see fit.

###Local Civil Rule 39.2. Order of Summation
After the close of evidence in civil trials, the order of summation shall be determined in the
discretion of the Court.

###Local Civil Rule 47.1. Assessment of Jury Costs
All counsel in civil cases shall seriously discuss the possibility of settlement a reasonable time
prior to trial. The Court may, in its discretion, assess the parties or counsel with the cost of one day's
attendance of the jurors if a case is settled after the jury has been summoned or during trial, the
amount to be paid to the Clerk of the Court. For purposes of this rule, a civil jury is considered
summoned for a trial as of Noon one day prior to the designated date of the trial.

###Local Civil Rule 53.1. Masters
(a) Oath. Every person appointed pursuant to Rule 53 shall before entering upon his or
her duties take and subscribe an oath, which, except as otherwise prescribed by statute or rule, shall
be the same as the oath prescribed for Judges pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 453, with the addition of the
words “in conformance with the order of appointment” after the words “administer justice.” Such
an oath may be taken before any federal or state officer authorized by federal law to administer oaths,
and shall be filed in the office of the Clerk.

(b) May Sit Outside District. A person appointed pursuant to Rule 53 may sit within or
outside the district. When the person appointed is requested to sit outside the district for the 
convenience of a party and there is opposition by another party, he or she may make an order for the
holding of the hearing, or a part thereof, outside the district, upon such terms and conditions as shall
be just. Such order may be reviewed by the Court upon motion of any party, served within
twenty-one (21) days after service on all parties by the master of the order. 

###Local Civil Rule 54.1. Taxable Costs
(a) __Notice of Taxation of Costs.__ Within thirty (30) days after the entry of final judgment,
or, in the case of an appeal by any party, within thirty (30) days after the final disposition of the
appeal, unless this period is extended by the Court for good cause shown, any party seeking to
recover costs shall file with the Clerk a notice of taxation of costs by Electronic Case Filing, except a
pro se party may do so in writing, indicating the date and time of taxation which shall comply with
the notice period prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 54, and annexing a bill of costs. Costs will not be
taxed during the pendency of any appeal, motion for reconsideration, or motion for a new trial. 
Within thirty (30) days after the determination of any appeal, motion for reconsideration, or motion
for a new trial, the party seeking tax costs shall file a new notice of taxation of costs. Any party failing
to file a notice of taxation of costs within the applicable thirty (30) day period will be deemed to have
waived costs. The bill of costs shall include an affidavit that the costs claimed are allowable by law,
are correctly stated and were necessarily incurred. Bills for the costs claimed shall be attached as
exhibits.

(b) __Objections to Bill of Costs.__ A party objecting to any cost item shall serve objections
by Electronic Case Filing, except a pro se party may do so in writing, prior to the date and time
scheduled for taxation. The parties need not appear at the date and time scheduled for taxation
unless requested by the Clerk. The Clerk will proceed to tax costs at the time scheduled and allow
such items as are properly taxable. In the absence of written objection, any item listed may be taxed
within the discretion of the Clerk.

(c) __Items Taxable as Costs__

  * (1) __Transcripts.__ The cost of any part of the original trial transcript that was
necessarily obtained for use in this Court or on appeal is taxable. Convenience of counsel is
not sufficient. The cost of a transcript of Court proceedings prior to or subsequent to trial
is taxable only when authorized in advance or ordered by the Court.
  * (2) __Depositions.__ Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, the original transcript of
a deposition, plus one copy, is taxable if the deposition was used or received in evidence at
the trial, whether or not it was read in its entirety. Costs for depositions are also taxable if
they were used by the Court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment or other dispositive
substantive motion. Costs for depositions taken solely for discovery are not taxable.
Counsel's fees and expenses in attending the taking of a deposition are not taxable except as
provided by statute, rule (including Local Civil Rule 30.1), or order of the Court. Fees,
mileage, and subsistence for the witness at the deposition are taxable at the same rates as for
attendance at trial if the deposition taken was used or received in evidence at the trial.
  * (3) __Witness Fees, Travel Expenses and Subsistence.__ Witness fees and travel
expenses authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 1821 are taxable if the witness testifies. Subsistence
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1821 is taxable if the witness testifies and it is not practical for the
witness to return to his or her residence from day to day. No party to the action may
receive witness fees, travel expenses, or subsistence. Fees for expert witnesses are taxable
only to the extent of fees for ordinary witnesses unless prior court approval was obtained.
  * (4) __Interpreting Costs.__ The reasonable fee of a competent interpreter is taxable if
the fee of the witness involved is taxable. 
  * (5) __Exemplifications and Copies of Papers.__ A copy of an exhibit is taxable if the
original was not available and the copy was used or received in evidence. The cost of copies
used for the convenience of counsel or the Court are not taxable. The fees for a search and
certification or proof of the non-existence of a document in a public office is taxable.
  * (6) __Maps, Charts, Models, Photographs and Summaries.__ The cost of
photographs, 8” x 10” in size or less, is taxable if used or received in evidence.
Enlargements greater than 8” x 10” are not taxable except by order of the Court. Costs of
maps, charts, and models, including computer generated models, are not taxable except by
order of the Court. The cost of compiling summaries, statistical comparisons and reports is 
not taxable.
  * (7) __Attorney Fees and Related Costs.__ Attorney fees and disbursements and other
related fees and paralegal expenses are not taxable except by order of the Court. A motion
for attorney fees and related nontaxable expenses shall be made within the time period
prescribed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 54.
  * (8) __Fees of Masters, Receivers, Commissioners and Court Appointed Experts.__
Fees of masters, receivers, commissioners, and Court appointed experts are taxable as costs, 
unless otherwise ordered by the Court.
  * (9) __Costs for Title Searches.__ A party is entitled to tax necessary disbursements for
the expenses of searches made by title insurance, abstract or searching companies.
  * (10) __Docket and Miscellaneous Fees.__ Docket fees, and the reasonable and actual
fees of the Clerk and of a marshal, sheriff, and process server, are taxable unless otherwise
ordered by the Court.

###Local Civil Rule 54.2. Security for Costs
The Court, on motion or on its own initiative, may order any party to file an original bond for
costs or additional security for costs in such an amount and so conditioned as it may designate. For
failure to comply with the order the Court may make such orders in regard to noncompliance as are
just, and among others the following: an order striking out pleadings or staying further proceedings
until the bond is filed or dismissing the action or rendering a judgment by default against the
non-complying party.

###Local Civil Rule 54.3. Entering Satisfaction of Money Judgment
Satisfaction of a money judgment entered or registered in this district shall be entered by the
Clerk as follows:

(a) Upon the payment into the Court of the amount thereof, plus interest, and the payment
of the Clerk's and marshal's fees, if any;

(b) Upon the filing of a satisfaction executed and acknowledged by: (1) the judgment
creditor; or (2) the judgment creditor's legal representatives or assigns, with evidence of their
authority; or (3) the judgment creditor's attorney if within ten (10) years of the entry of the judgment
or decree;

(c) If the judgment creditor is the United States, upon the filing of a satisfaction executed by
the United States Attorney;

(d) Pursuant to an order of satisfaction entered by the Court; or

(e) Upon the registration of a certified copy of a satisfaction entered in another court.

###Local Civil Rule 55.1. Certificate of Default
A party applying for a certificate of default by the Clerk pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a) shall
submit an affidavit showing (1) that the party against whom a notation of default is sought is not an
infant, in the military, or an incompetent person; (2) that the party has failed to plead or otherwise
defend the action; and (3) that the pleading to which no response has been made was properly
served.

###Local Civil Rule 55.2. Default Judgment
(a) __By the Clerk.__ Upon issuance of a Clerk's certificate of default, if the claim to which no
response has been made only sought payment of a sum certain, and does not include a request for
attorney's fees or other substantive relief, and if a default judgment is sought against all remaining
parties to the action, the moving party shall submit an affidavit showing the principal amount due
and owing, not exceeding the amount sought in the claim to which no response has been made, plus
interest, if any, computed by the party, with credit for all payments received to date clearly set forth,
and costs, if any, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920.

(b) __By the Court.__ In all other cases the party seeking a judgment by default shall apply to
the Court as described in Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2), and shall append to the application (1) the Clerk's
certificate of default, (2) a copy of the claim to which no response has been made, and (3) a proposed
form of default judgment.

(c) __Mailing of Papers.__ Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, all papers submitted to
the Court pursuant to Local Civil Rule 55.2(a) or (b) above shall simultaneously be mailed to the
party against whom a default judgment is sought at the last known residence of such party (if an
individual) or the last known business address of such party (if a person other than an individual).
Proof of such mailing shall be filed with the Court. If the mailing is returned, a supplemental
affidavit shall be filed with the Court setting forth that fact, together with the reason provided for
return, if any.

###Local Civil Rule 56.1. Statements of Material Facts on Motion for Summary Judgment
a) Upon any motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, there shall be annexed to the notice of motion a separate, short and concise statement, in
numbered paragraphs, of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no
genuine issue to be tried. Failure to submit such a statement may constitute grounds for denial of the
motion.

(b) The papers opposing a motion for summary judgment shall include a correspondingly
numbered paragraph responding to each numbered paragraph in the statement of the moving party,
and if necessary, additional paragraphs containing a separate, short and concise statement of
additional material facts as to which it is contended that there exists a genuine issue to be tried.

(c) Each numbered paragraph in the statement of material facts set forth in the statement 
required to be served by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted for purposes of the motion
unless specifically controverted by a correspondingly numbered paragraph in the statement required
to be served by the opposing party.

(d) Each statement by the movant or opponent pursuant to Rule 56.1(a) and (b), including
each statement controverting any statement of material fact, must be followed by citation to evidence
which would be admissible, set forth as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).

###Local Civil Rule 56.2. Notice to Pro Se Litigant Who Opposes a Summary Judgment
Any represented party moving for summary judgment against a party proceeding pro se shall
serve and file as a separate document, together with the papers in support of the motion, the
following “Notice To Pro Se Litigant Who Opposes a Motion For Summary Judgment” with the full
texts of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and Local Civil Rule 56.1 attached. Where the pro se party is not the
plaintiff, the movant shall amend the form notice as necessary to reflect that fact.

__Notice To Pro Se Litigant Who Opposes a Motion For Summary Judgment__

The defendant in this case has moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This means that the defendant has asked the Court to decide this
case without a trial, based on written materials, including affidavits, submitted in support of the
motion. THE CLAIMS YOU ASSERT IN YOUR COMPLAINT MAY BE DISMISSED
WITHOUT A TRIAL IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS MOTION ON TIME by filing
sworn affidavits and/or other documents as required by Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and by Local Civil Rule 56.1. The full text of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure and Local Civil Rule 56.1 is attached.

In short, Rule 56 provides that you may NOT oppose summary judgment simply by relying
upon the allegations in your complaint. Rather, you must submit evidence, such as witness
statements or documents, countering the facts asserted by the defendant and raising specific facts
that support your claim. If you have proof of your claim, now is the time to submit it. Any
witness statements must be in the form of affidavits. An affidavit is a sworn statement of fact based

different district, such application may be transferred to any district which is found by the assigned
Judge to be more convenient. The Clerks of the Southern and Eastern District Courts are
authorized and directed to transfer such applications to the District herein designated for filing,
hearing and determination.

deem advisable.

(b) Unless otherwise ordered, notices for the sale of real estate or of any interest in land shall
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the real estate or the land in

###Local Civil Rule 83.5. Notice of Sale [formerly Local Civil Rule 83.7]
In any civil action, the notice of any proposed sale of property directed to be made by any
order or judgment of the Court, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, need not set out the terms of
sale specified in the order or judgment, and the notice will be sufficient if in substantially the
following form:

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
…………..DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
[CAPTION],
[Docket No. and Judge's Initials]
NOTICE OF SALE
Pursuant to ........(Order or Judgment)......... of the United States District Court for the ...........................
District of New York, filed in the office of the clerk on ........(Date)............. in the case entitled
...........................(Name and Docket Number)............................ the undersigned will sell at
....................(Place of Sale).............................. on .............(Date and Hour of Sale).............. the property in
said .........(Order or Judgment)............ described and therein directed to be sold, to which ......(Order
or Judgment)........... reference is made for the terms of sale and for a description of the property
which may be briefly described as follows:
Dated:
________________________
Signature and Official Title

The notice need not describe the property by metes and bounds or otherwise in detail and
will be sufficient if in general terms it identifies the property by specifying its nature and location.
However, it shall state: the approximate acreage of any real estate outside the limits of any town or
city; the street, lot and block number of any real estate within any town or city; and a general
statement of the character of any improvements upon the property.

###Local Civil Rule 83.6. Contempt Proceedings in Civil Cases [formerly Local Civil Rule 83.9]
(a) A proceeding to adjudicate a person in civil contempt, including a case provided for in
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(1) and 37(b)(2)(A)(vii), shall be commenced by the service of a notice of motion
or order to show cause. The affidavit upon which such notice of motion or order to show cause is
based shall set out with particularity the misconduct complained of, the claim, if any, for damages
occasioned thereby and such evidence as to the amount of damages as may be available to the
moving party. A reasonable counsel fee, necessitated by the contempt proceedings, may be
included as an item of damage. Where the alleged contemnor has appeared in the action by an
attorney, the notice of motion or order to show cause and the papers upon which it is based may be
served upon said attorney; otherwise service shall be made personally, together with a copy of this
Local Civil Rule 83.6, in the manner provided for by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the 
service of a summons. If an order to show cause is sought, such order may, upon necessity shown,
embody a direction to the United States marshal to arrest the alleged contemnor and hold such
person unless bail is posted in an amount fixed by the order, conditioned on the appearance of such
person in all further proceedings on the motion, and further conditioned that the alleged contemnor
will hold himself or herself amenable to all orders of the Court for surrender.

b) If the alleged contemnor puts in issue his or her alleged misconduct or the damages
thereby occasioned, said person shall upon demand be entitled to have oral evidence taken, either
before the Court or before a master appointed by the Court. When by law such alleged contemnor
is entitled to a trial by jury, said person shall make written demand before the beginning of the
hearing on the application; otherwise the alleged contemnor will be deemed to have waived a trial by
jury.

(c) If the alleged contemnor is found to be in contempt of court, an order shall be entered
(1) reciting or referring to the verdict or findings of fact upon which the adjudication is based; (2)
setting forth the amount of damages, if any, to which the complainant is entitled; (3) fixing the fine, if 
any, imposed by the Court, which fine shall include the damages found and naming the person to
whom such fine shall be payable; (4) stating any other conditions, the performance of which will
operate to purge the contempt; and (5) directing, where appropriate, the arrest of the contemnor by
the United States marshal and confinement until the performance of the condition fixed in the order
and the payment of the fine, or until the contemnor be otherwise discharged pursuant to law. A
certified copy of the order committing the contemnor shall be sufficient warrant to the marshal for
the arrest and confinement of the contemnor. The complainant shall also have the same remedies
against the property of the contemnor as if the order awarding the fine were a final judgment.

(d) If the alleged contemnor is found not guilty of the charges, said person shall be
discharged from the proceedings and, in the discretion of the Court, may have judgment against the
complainant for costs and disbursements and a reasonable counsel fee.

###Local Civil Rule 83.7. Court-Annexed Arbitration (Eastern District Only) [formerly Local Civil Rule 83.10]

(hereafter referred to as the certifying Judge) shall certify as many arbitrators as may be
determined to be necessary under this rule.

required by Title 28, U.S.C. § 453 before serving as an arbitrator.
  * (4) A list of all persons certified as arbitrators shall be maintained in the

(b) __Compensation and Expenses of Arbitrators.__ An arbitrator shall be compensated
$250 for services in each case. If an arbitration hearing is protracted, the certifying Judge may

arbitrator shall be compensated $100 for service. The fees shall be paid by or pursuant to the order
of the Court subject to the limits set by the Judicial Conference of the United States.

(c) __Immunity of Arbitrators.__ Arbitrators shall be immune from liability or suit with
respect to their conduct as such to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

(d) __Civil Cases Eligible for Compulsory Arbitration.__

  * (1) The Clerk of Court shall, as to all cases filed after January 1, 1986, designate and
process for compulsory arbitration all civil cases (excluding social security cases, tax matters,
prisoners' civil rights cases and any action based on an alleged violation of a right secured by
the Constitution of the United States or if jurisdiction is based in whole or in part on Title 28,
U.S.C. § 1343) wherein money damages only are being sought in an amount not in excess of
$150,000.00 exclusive of interest and costs.
  * (2) The parties may by written stipulation agree that the Clerk of Court shall
designate and process for court-annexed arbitration any civil case that is not subject to
compulsory arbitration hereunder.
  * (3) For purposes of this Rule only, in all civil cases damages shall be presumed to be
not in excess of $150,000.00 exclusive of interest and costs, unless:
    * (A) Counsel for plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint, or in the event of
the removal of a case from state court or transfer of a case from another district to
this Court, within thirty (30) days of the docketing of the case in this district, files a 
certification with the Court that the damages sought exceed $150,000.00, exclusive of
interest and costs; or
    * (B) Counsel for a defendant, at the time of filing a counterclaim or
cross-claim files a certification with the court that the damages sought by the
counter-claim or cross-claim exceed $150,000.00 exclusive of interest and costs.

(e) __Referral to Arbitration.__

  * (1) After an answer is filed in a case determined eligible for arbitration, the arbitration
clerk shall send a notice to counsel setting forth the date and time for the arbitration hearing.
The date of the arbitration hearing set forth in the notice shall be approximately four months
but in no event later than 120 days from the date the answer was filed, except that the
arbitration proceeding shall not, in the absence of the consent of the parties, commence until 
30 days after the disposition by the District Court of any motion to dismiss the complaint,
motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion to join necessary parties, or motion for
summary judgment, if the motion was filed during a time period specified by the District
Court. The 120-day and 30-day periods specified in the preceding sentence may be
modified by the court for good cause shown. The notice shall also advise counsel that they
may agree to an earlier date for the arbitration hearing provided the arbitration clerk is
notified with 30 days of the date of the notice. The notice shall also advise counsel that they
have 90 days to complete discovery unless the Judge to whom the case has been assigned orders a shorter or longer period for discovery. The Judge may refer the case to a Magistrate Judge for purposes of
discovery. In the event a third party has been brought into the action, this notice shall not
be sent until an answer has been filed by the third party.
  * (2) The Court shall, sua sponte, or on motion of a party, exempt any case from
arbitration in which the objectives of arbitration would not be realized
    * (A) because the case involves complex or novel issues,
    * (B) because legal issues predominate over factual issues, or
    * (C) for other good cause.
Application by a party for an exemption from compulsory arbitration shall be made by
written letter to the Court not exceeding three pages in length, outlining the basis for the
request and attaching relevant materials, which shall be submitted no later than 21 days after
receipt of the notice to counsel setting forth the date and time for the arbitration hearing.
Within four days of receiving such a letter, any opposing affected party may submit a
responsive letter not exceeding three pages attaching relevant materials.
  * (3) Cases not originally designated as eligible for compulsory arbitration, but which in
the discretion of the assigned Judge, are later found to qualify, may be referred to arbitration.
A U.S. District Judge or a U.S. Magistrate Judge, in cases that exceed the arbitration ceiling of
$150,000 exclusive of interest and costs, in their discretion, may suggest that the parties 
should consider arbitration. If the parties are agreeable, an appropriate consent form signed
by all parties or their representatives may be entered and filed in the case prior to scheduling
an arbitration hearing.
  * (4) The arbitration shall be held before one arbitrator unless a panel of three
arbitrators is requested by a party, in which case one of whom shall be designated as
chairperson of the panel. If the amount of controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, is
$5,000 or less, the arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator. The arbitration panel
shall be chosen at random by the Clerk of the Court from the lawyers who have been duly
certified as arbitrators. The arbitration panel shall be scheduled to hear not more than three
cases.
  * (5) The Judge to whom the case has been assigned shall, 30 days prior to the date
scheduled for the arbitration hearing, sign an order setting forth the date and time of the
arbitration hearing and the names of the arbitrators designated to hear the case. If a party
has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, summary judgment or similar relief, the 
Judge shall not sign the order before ruling on the motion, but the filing of such a motion on
or after the date of the order shall not stay the arbitration unless the Judge so orders.

to each arbitrator a copy of all pleadings, including the order designating the arbitrators, and
the guidelines for arbitrators.
  * (7) Persons selected to be arbitrators shall be disqualified for bias or prejudice as
provided in Title 28, U.S.C. § 144, and shall disqualify themselves in any action which they
would be required under title 28, U.S.C. § 455 to disqualify themselves if they were a justice,
judge, or magistrate.

(f) __Arbitration Hearing.__

  * (1) The arbitration hearing shall take place in the United States Courthouse in a
courtroom assigned by the arbitration clerk on the date and at the time set forth in the order
of the Court. The arbitrators are authorized to change the date and time of the hearing
provided the hearing is commenced within 30 days of the hearing date set forth in the order 
of the Court. Any continuance beyond this 30 day period must be approved by the Judge to
whom the case has been assigned. The arbitration clerk must be notified immediately of any
continuance.
  * (2) Counsel for the parties shall report settlement of the case to the arbitration clerk
and all members of the arbitration panel assigned to the case.
  * (3) The arbitration hearing may proceed in the absence of any party who, after notice,
fails to be present. In the event, however, that a party fails to participate in the arbitration
process in a meaningful manner, the Court may impose appropriate sanctions, including, but
not limited to, the striking of any demand for a trial de novo filed by that party.
  * (4) Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to subpoenas for
attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence at an arbitration hearing
under this Rule. Testimony at an arbitration hearing shall be under oath or affirmation.
  * (5) The Federal Rules of Evidence shall be used as guides to the admissibility of
evidence. Copies or photographs of all exhibits, except those intended solely for
impeachment, must be marked for identification and delivered to adverse parties at least
fourteen (14) days prior to the hearing. The arbitrators shall receive exhibits in evidence
without formal proof unless counsel has been notified at least seven (7) days prior to the
hearing that the adverse party intends to raise an issue concerning the authenticity of the
exhibit. The arbitrators may refuse to receive in evidence any exhibit, a copy or photograph
of which has not been delivered to the adverse party as provided herein.
  * (6) A party may have a recording and transcript made of the arbitration hearing, but
that party shall make all necessary arrangements and bear all expenses thereof.

(g) __Arbitration Award and Judgment.__

  * (1) The arbitration award shall be filed with the Court promptly after the hearing is
concluded and shall be entered as the judgment of the Court after the 30 day period for 
requesting a trial de novo pursuant to Section (h) has expired, unless a party has demanded a
trial de novo. The judgment so entered shall be subject to the same provisions of law and
shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of the Court in a civil action, except that it
shall not be appealable. In a case involving multiple claims and parties, any segregable part
of an arbitration award as to which an aggrieved party has not timely demanded a trial de
novo shall become part of the final judgment with the same force and effect as a judgment of
the Court in a civil action, except that it shall not be appealable.
  * (2) The contents of any arbitration award shall not be made known to any Judge who
might be assigned the case,
    * (A) except as necessary for the Court to determine whether to assess costs or
attorneys fees,
    * (B) until the District Court has entered final judgment in the action or the
action has been otherwise terminated, or
    * (C) except for purposes of preparing the report required by section 903(b) of
the Judicial Improvement and Access to Justice Act.
  * (3) Costs may be taxed as part of any arbitration award pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920.

(h) __Trial De Novo.__

  * (1) Within 30 days after the arbitration award is entered on the docket, any party may
demand in writing a trial de novo in the District Court. Such demand shall be filed with the 
arbitration clerk, and served by the moving party upon all counsel of record or other parties.
Withdrawal of a demand for a trial de novo shall not reinstate the arbitrators' award and the
case shall proceed as if it had not been arbitrated.
  * (2) Upon demand for a trial de novo and the payment to the Clerk required by
paragraph (4) of this section, the action shall be placed on the calendar of the Court and
treated for all purposes as if it had not been referred to arbitration, and any right of trial by 
jury that a party would otherwise have shall be preserved inviolate.
  * (3) At the trial de novo, the Court shall not admit evidence that there had been an
arbitration proceeding, the nature or amount of the award, or any other matter concerning
the conduct of the arbitration proceeding.
  * (4) Upon making a demand for trial de novo the moving party shall, unless permitted
to proceed in forma pauperis, deposit with the Clerk of the Court an amount equal to the
arbitration fees of the arbitrators as provided in Section (b). The sum so deposited shall be
returned to the party demanding a trial de novo in the event that party obtains a final
judgment, exclusive of interest and costs, more favorable than the arbitration award. If the
party demanding a trial de novo does not obtain a more favorable result after trial or if the
Court determines that the party's conduct in seeking a trial de novo was in bad faith, the sum 
so deposited shall be paid by the Clerk to the Treasury of the United States.

###Local Civil Rule 83.8. Court-Annexed Mediation (Eastern District Only) [formerly Local Civil Rule 83.11]
(a) __Description.__ Mediation is a process in which parties and counsel agree to meet with a
neutral mediator trained to assist them in settling disputes. The mediator improves communication
across party lines, helps parties articulate their interests and understand those of the other party,
probes the strengths and weaknesses of each party's legal positions, and identifies areas of agreement
and helps generate options for a mutually agreeable resolution to the dispute. In all cases, mediation
provides an opportunity to explore a wide range of potential solutions and to address interests that
may be outside the scope of the stated controversy or which could not be addressed by judicial
action. A hallmark of mediation is its capacity to expand traditional settlement discussions and
broaden resolution options, often by exploring litigant needs and interests that may be formally
independent of the legal issues in controversy.

(b) __Mediation Procedures.__

  * (1) Eligible cases. Judges and Magistrate Judges may designate civil cases for
inclusion in the mediation program, and when doing so shall prepare an order to that effect.
Alternatively, and subject to the availability of qualified mediators, the parties may consent to
participation in the mediation program by preparing and executing a stipulation signed by all
parties to the action and so-ordered by the Court.
    * (A) Mediation deadline. Any court order designating a case for inclusion in the
mediation program, however arrived at, may contain a deadline not to exceed six
months from the date of entry on the docket of that order. This deadline may be
extended upon motion to the Court for good cause shown.
  * (2) Mediators. Parties whose case has been designated for inclusion in the
mediation program shall be offered the options of (a) using a mediator from the Court's
panel, a listing of which is available in the Clerk's Office; (b) selecting a mediator on their
own; or (c) seeking the assistance of a reputable neutral ADR organization in the selection of 
a mediator.
    * (A) Court's panel of mediators. When the parties opt to use a mediator
from the Court's panel, the Clerk's Office will appoint a mediator to handle the case
who (i) has been for at least five years a member of the bar of a state or the District of
Columbia; (ii) is admitted to practice before this Court; and (iii) has completed the
Court's requirements for mediator training and mediator expertise. If any party so
requests, the appointed mediator also shall have expertise in the area of law in the
case. The Clerk's Office will provide notice of their appointment to all counsel.
    * (B) Disqualification. Any party may submit a written request to the Clerk's
Office within fourteen days from the date of the notification of the mediator for the
disqualification of the mediator for bias or prejudice as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 144.
A denial of such a request by the Clerk's Office is subject to review by the assigned 
Judge upon motion filed within fourteen (14) days of the date of the Clerk's Office
denial.
  * (3) Scheduling the mediation. The mediator, however chosen, will contact all
attorneys to fix the date and place of the first mediation session, which shall be held within
thirty days of the date the mediator was appointed or at such other time as the Court may
establish.
    * (A) The Clerk's Office will provide counsel with copies of the Judge's order
referring the case to the mediation program, the Clerk's Office notice of appointment
of mediator (if applicable), and a copy of the program procedures.
  * (4) Written mediation statements. No less than fourteen (14) days prior to the first
mediation session, each party shall submit directly to the mediator a mediation statement not
to exceed ten pages double-spaced, not including exhibits, outlining the key facts and legal
issues in the case. The statement will also include a description of motions filed and their
status, and any other information that will advance settlement prospects or make the
mediation more productive. Mediation statements are not briefs and are not filed with the
Court, nor shall the assigned Judge or Magistrate Judge have access to them.
  * (5) Mediation session(s). The mediator meets initially with all parties to the dispute
and their counsel in a joint session. The mediator may hold mediation sessions in his/her
office, or at the Court, or at such other place as the parties and the mediator shall agree. At
this meeting, the mediator explains the mediation process and gives each party an opportunity
to explain his or her views about the matters in dispute. There is then likely to be discussion 
and questioning among the parties as well as between the mediator and the parties.
    * (A) Separate caucuses. At the conclusion of the joint session, the mediator
will typically caucus individually with each party. Caucuses permit the mediator and
the parties to explore more fully the needs and interests underlying the stated
positions. In caucuses the mediator strives to facilitate settlement on matters in
dispute and the possibilities for settlement. In some cases the mediator may offer
specific suggestions for settlement; in other cases the mediator may help the parties
generate creative settlement proposals.
    * (B) Additional sessions. The mediator may conduct additional joint sessions
to promote further direct discussion between the parties, or she/he may continue to
work with the parties in private caucuses.
    * (C) Conclusion. The mediation concludes when the parties reach a mutually
acceptable resolution, when the parties fail to reach an agreement, on the date the
Judge or Magistrate Judge specified as the mediation deadline in their designation
order, or in the event no such date has been specified by the Court, at such other time
as the parties and/or the mediator may determine. The mediator has no power to
impose settlement and the mediation process is confidential, whether or not a
settlement is reached.
  * (6) Settlement. If settlement is reached, in whole or in part, the agreement, which
shall be binding upon all parties, will be put into writing and counsel will file a stipulation of
dismissal or such other document as may be appropriate. If the case does not settle, the
mediator will immediately notify the Clerk's Office, and the case or the portion of the case 
that has not settled will continue in the litigation process.

(c) __Attendance at Mediation Sessions.__

  * (1) In all civil cases designated by the Court for inclusion in the mediation program,
attendance at one mediation session shall be mandatory; thereafter, attendance shall be
voluntary. The Court requires of each party that the attorney who has primary responsibility
for handling the trial of the matter attend the mediation sessions.
  * (2) In addition, the Court may require, and if it does not, the mediator may require
the attendance at the mediation session of a party or its representative in the case of a
business or governmental entity or a minor, with authority to settle the matter and to bind the
party. This requirement reflects the Court's view that the principal values of mediation
include affording litigants with an opportunity to articulate their positions and interests
directly to the other parties and to a mediator and to hear, first hand, the other party's version
of the matters in dispute. Mediation also enables parties to search directly with the other party for mutually
agreeable solutions.

(d) __Confidentiality.__

  * (1) The parties will be asked to sign an agreement of confidentiality at the beginning
of the first mediation session to the following effect:
    * (A) Unless the parties otherwise agree, all written and oral communications
made by the parties and the mediator in connection with or during any mediation
session are confidential and may not be disclosed or used for any purpose unrelated
to the mediation.
    * (B) The mediator shall not be called by any party as a witness in any court
proceeding related to the subject matter of the mediation unless related to the alleged
misconduct of the mediator.
  * (2) Mediators will maintain the confidentiality of all information provided to, or
discussed with, them. The Clerk of Court and the ADR Administrator are responsible for
program administration, evaluation, and liaison between the mediators and the Court and will
maintain strict confidentiality.
  * (3) No papers generated by the mediation process will be included in Court files, nor
shall the Judge or Magistrate Judge assigned to the case have access to them. Information
about what transpires during mediation sessions will not at any time be made known to the
Court, except to the extent required to resolve issues of noncompliance with the mediation
procedures. However, communications made in connection with or during a mediation may
be disclosed if all parties and, if appropriate as determined by the mediator, the mediator so
agree. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit parties from entering into
written agreements resolving some or all of the case or entering and filing with the Court
procedural or factual stipulations based on suggestions or agreements made in connection 
with a mediation.

(e) __Oath and Disqualification of Mediator.__

  * (1) Each individual certified as a mediator shall take the oath or affirmation
prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 453 before serving as a mediator.
  * (2) No mediator may serve in any matter in violation of the standards set forth in 28
U.S.C. § 455. If a mediator is concerned that a circumstance covered by subparagraph (a) of
that section might exist, e.g., if the mediator's law firm has represented one or more of the
parties, or if one of the lawyers who would appear before the mediator at the mediation
session is involved in a case on which an attorney in the mediator's firm is working, the
mediator shall promptly disclose that circumstance to all counsel in writing. A party who
believes that the assigned mediator has a conflict of interest shall bring this concern to the 
attention of the Clerk's Office in writing, within fourteen (14) days of learning the source of
the potential conflict or the objection to such a potential conflict shall be deemed to have
been waived. Any objections that cannot be resolved by the parties in consultation with the
Clerk's Office shall be referred to the Judge or Magistrate Judge who has designated the case
for inclusion in the mediation program.
  * (3) A party who believes that the assigned mediator has engaged in misconduct in
such capacity shall bring this concern to the attention of the Clerk's Office in writing, within
fourteen (14) days of learning of the alleged misconduct or the objection to such alleged
misconduct shall be deemed to have been waived. Any objections that cannot be resolved
by the parties in consultation with the Clerk's Office shall be referred to the Judge who has
designated the case for inclusion in the mediation program.

(f) __Services of the Mediators.__

  * (1) Participation by mediators in the program is on a voluntary basis. Each
mediator shall receive a fee of $600 for the first four hours or less of the actual mediation.
Time spent preparing for the mediation will not be compensated. Thereafter, the mediator
shall be compensated at the rate of $250 per hour. The mediator's fee shall be paid by the
parties to the mediation. Any party that is unable or unwilling to pay the fee may apply to
the referring judge for a waiver of the fee, with a right of appeal to the district judge in the
event the referral was made by a magistrate judge. Each member of the panel will be
required to mediate a maximum of two cases pro bono each year, if requested by the Court.
Attorneys serving on the Court's panel will be given credit for pro bono work.
  * (2) Appointment to the Court's panel is for a three year term, subject to renewal. A
panelist will not be expected to serve on more than two cases during any twelve month
period and will not be required to accept each assignment offered. Repeated rejection of
assignments will result in the attorney being dropped from the panel.

(g) __Immunity of the Mediators.__ Mediators shall be immune from liability or suit with
respect to their conduct as such to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. 

###Local Civil Rule 83.9. Alternative Dispute Resolution (Southern District Only) [formerly Local Civil Rule 83.12]
(a) __Definition__ Mediation is a form of alternative dispute resolution. In mediation, parties and
counsel meet, sometimes collectively and sometimes individually, with a neutral third party (the
mediator) who has been trained to facilitate confidential settlement discussions. The parties articulate
their respective positions and interests and generate options for a mutually agreeable resolution to the
dispute. The mediator assists the parties in reaching their own negotiated settlement by defining the
issues, probing and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each party's legal positions, and
identifying areas of agreement and disagreement. The main benefits of mediation are that it can result
in an expeditious and less costly resolution of the litigation, and can produce creative solutions to
complex disputes often unavailable in traditional litigation.

(b) __Administration__

  * (1) The Mediation Supervisor, appointed by the Clerk of the Court, shall administer
the Court's mediation program. The Chief Judge shall appoint one or more District Judges or
Magistrate Judges to oversee the program.
  * (2) The Mediation Supervisor, in consultation with other Court personnel, shall
ensure that information about the Court's mediation program is available on the Court's
website which will be updated as needed.
  * (3) The mediation program shall be governed by the “Procedures of the Mediation
Program for the Southern District of New York,” which sets forth specific and more detailed
information regarding the mediation program, and which is available on the Court's official
website (w w w . n y s d . u s c o u r t s . g o v ) or from the Mediation Office.
  * (4) In no event is the scheduling of mediation to interfere with any scheduling order
of the Court. 

(c) __Consideration of Mediation__ In all civil cases eligible for mediation pursuant to
paragraph (d), each party shall consider the use of mediation and shall report to the assigned Judge at
the initial Rule 16(b) case management conference, or subsequently, whether the party believes
mediation may facilitate the resolution of the lawsuit. Judges are encouraged to note the availability of
the mediation program before, at, or after the initial Rule 16(b) case management conference.

(d) __Entry into the Program__

  * (1) All civil cases other than social security, habeas corpus, and tax cases are eligible
for mediation, whether assigned to Manhattan or White Plains.
  * (2) The Board of Judges may, by Administrative Order, direct that certain specified
categories of cases shall automatically be submitted to the mediation program. The assigned
District Judge or Magistrate Judge may issue a written order exempting a particular case with 
or without the request of the parties.
  * (3) For all other cases, the assigned District Judge or Magistrate Judge may determine
that a case is appropriate for mediation and may order that case to mediation, with or without
the consent of the parties, before, at, or after the initial Rule 16(b) case management
conference. Alternatively, the parties should notify the assigned Judge at any time of their
desire to mediate.
