A person who furnishes supplies or services to a vessel, cargo, or other property in custody of

shall submit an invoice to the clerk in the form of a verified claim at any time before the vessel, cargo
or other property is released or sold. The supplier must serve copies of the claim on the marshal,
substitute custodian if one has been appointed, and all parties of record. The court may consider
the claims individually or schedule a single hearing for all claims.
