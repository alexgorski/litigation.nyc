The summons issued pursuant to Supplemental Rule C(3)(c) shall direct the person having
control of freight or proceeds of property sold or other intangible property to show cause at a date
which shall be at least fourteen (14) days after service (unless the court, for good cause shown,
shortens the period) why the intangible property should not be delivered to the court to abide the
judgment. The person who is served may deliver or pay over to the marshal the intangible property
proceeded against to the extent sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. If such delivery or payment
is made, the person served is excused from the duty to show cause.
