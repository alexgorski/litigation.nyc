(a) __Presentation of Claim.__ When a vessel or other property has been arrested, attached,
or garnished, and is in the hands of the marshal or custodian substituted therefor, anyone having a
claim against the vessel or property is required to present the claim by filing an intervening complaint,
and not by filing an original complaint, unless otherwise ordered by a judicial officer. Upon the
satisfaction of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, the clerk shall forthwith
deliver a conformed copy of the complaint to the marshal, who shall deliver the copy to the vessel or
custodian of the property. Intervenors shall thereafter be subject to the rights and obligations of
parties, and the vessel or property shall stand arrested, attached, or garnished by the intervenor.

(b) __Sharing Marshal's Fees and Expenses.__ An intervenor shall have a responsibility to
the first plaintiff, enforceable on motion, consisting of the intervenor's share of the marshal's fees
and expenses in the proportion that the intervenor's claim bears to the sum of all the claims. If a
party plaintiff permits vacation of an arrest, attachment, or garnishment, remaining plaintiffs share
the responsibility to the marshal for the fees and expenses in proportion to the remaining claims and
for the duration of the marshal's custody because of each claim.
