rule_title: Assignments to Senior Judges
---

If a senior judge is willing and able to undertake assignment of new cases for all purposes,
that judge shall advise the assignment committee of the number and categories of new cases which
that judge is willing and able to undertake. New cases in the requested number in each category
shall then be assigned to that judge in the same manner as new cases are assigned to active judges.
If a senior judge is willing and able to undertake assignment of pending cases from other
judges, that judge may (1) accept assignment of all or any part of any case from any judge on mutual
consent, or (2) advise the assignment committee of the number, status and categories of pending
cases which that judge is willing to undertake. Such cases will be drawn by lot from current lists
provided to the assignment committee by the judges wishing to transfer cases under this rule. If a
senior judge does not terminate any action so transferred, it shall be reassigned to the transferor
judge.
