If the Judge to whom the case is assigned determines that it should be assigned to the other
courthouse under these rules, it is sent to the Clerk for reassignment to a judge in the other
courthouse. If upon reassignment there is a dispute as to the proper place of holding court, it will
be referred to the Assignment Committee for final determination. If the case is reassigned, it will be
reassigned as if it were a new filing, but will retain its original case number.
