(a) Filing with the Clerk.
All civil actions and proceedings shall be numbered consecutively by year upon the filing of
the first document in the case.
When a complaint or the first document is filed in a civil action or proceeding, counsel shall
accurately complete and file form JS44C-SDNY: Civil Court Cover Sheet, in triplicate, consistent
with Rule 18 below.

(b) Assignment by the Clerk by Lot.
 Each civil action and proceeding, except applications for leave to proceed in forma pauperis,
upon being filed and each appeal from the bankruptcy court upon being docketed in this court shall
be assigned by lot within each designated category to a district judge for all purposes.
An action, case or proceeding may not be dismissed and thereafter refiled for the purpose of
obtaining a different judge. If an action, case or proceeding, or one essentially the same, is
dismissed and refiled, it shall be assigned to the same judge. It is the duty of every attorney
appearing to bring the facts of the refiling to the attention of the clerk.
