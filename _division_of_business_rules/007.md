When the assignment committee certifies that a case requires extraordinary priority or a
prompt trial or other disposition, it shall so advise the judge to whom the case has been assigned.
The judge so assigned shall advise the assignment committee whether that judge can accord the case
the required priority. In the event the judge so assigned advises the assignment committee that he
or she cannot accord the required priority, the case shall immediately be assigned to another judge by
lot and the same procedure followed until the case is assigned to a judge able to accord it the required
priority. The name of the judge to be so assigned shall be drawn by lot in the same manner as other
civil and criminal actions are initially assigned.
