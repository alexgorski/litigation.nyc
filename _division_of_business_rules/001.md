This court shall operate under an individual assignment system to assure continuous and
close judicial supervision of every case. Each civil and criminal action and proceeding, except as
otherwise provided, shall be assigned by lot to one judge for all purposes. The system shall be
administered by an assignment committee in such a manner that all active judges, except the chief
judge, shall be assigned substantially an equal share of the categories of cases of the court over a
period of time. There shall be assigned or transferred to the chief judge such matters as the chief
judge is willing and able to undertake, consistent with the chief judge's administrative duties.
