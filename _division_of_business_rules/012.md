When a visiting judge is assigned to this district, that judge shall advise the assignment
committee of the number and categories of pending cases which that judge is required or willing to
accept. The assignment committee shall then transfer to that judge the required number of cases in
each category with the consent of the transferor judge. If the visiting judge does not terminate the
action, it shall be reassigned to the transferor judge.
