When a new judge is inducted, the assignment committee shall transfer to the new judge an
equal share of all cases then pending (including cases on the suspense docket).
The cases shall be taken equally, by lot, from the dockets of each of the judges' most recent
chronological list of cases which have been designated by the transferor as eligible for transfer, except
if the Assignment Committee determines that the interests of court administration requires an
alternative method of reassignment. No case shall be transferred without the consent of the
transferor judge. The assignment committee shall also direct the clerk to add the name of the new
judge to the random selection system for assigning new cases to active judges.
